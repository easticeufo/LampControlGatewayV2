            File upload permits multiple files. Iterate over all uploaded files.
            The file is uploaded to a temporary file file->filename. The original
            client filename is file->clientFilename. This page should copy, move
            or process the temporary file. The temporary will be automatically 
            removed when this page completes.

            The reason for using a temporary is that multiple clients may upload
            a file with the same filename at the same time. Temporary filenames
            are unique and solve potential conflicts.
