.SH DESCRIPTION
The appman program is used to configure the running of Appweb as a system service (daemon).
Appman provides a generic way to install/uninstall, enable/disable, start/stop, and run the Appweb service, regardless
of the operating system. When used to run Appweb, it starts Appweb and then watches over Appweb, to restart it 
should Appweb fail. Appman also provides general management commands to enable, disable, start, and stop appweb.
