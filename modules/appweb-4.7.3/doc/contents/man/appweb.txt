DESCRIPTION
       Appweb  is  a  compact  embedded HTTP web server.  It is a fast, small-
       footprint, multi-threaded, standards-based, portable  server  developed
       for  use  by embedded devices and applications.  It can run as a stand-
       alone web server or the Appweb library can be embedded in applications.

       Appweb supports HTTP/1.1, SSL, digest and basic authentication, virtual
       hosting, ranged requests, chunked transfers, file upload  and  security
       limits.  Appweb has an Apache style configuration file and supports the
       PHP and Ejscript web frameworks.

       Appweb normally reads the appweb.conf  file  for  configuration  direc-
       tives.  However, if appweb is invoked with an IP address or port number
       on the command line, Appweb  will  not  read  the  configuration  file.
       Rather it will listen for requests on the specified IP:PORT address. If
       the PORT component is omitted, Appweb will listen on port 80. If the IP
       address  is  omitted  and a port is supplied, Appweb will listen on all
       network interfaces.

       Appweb responds to the SIGUSR2 signal and toggles the trace level  from
       2 to 4 and vice-versa. Appweb responds to the SIGINFO|SIGPWR signal and
       emits operational stats to the trace log.

OPTIONS
       --config filename
              Define the name of the Appweb configuration  file.  This  is  by
              default appweb.

       --chroot directory
              Change  the  system  root  directory  for Appweb. This creates a
              chroot jail so that the Appweb process cannot access  any  files
              outside the given directory.

       --debugger
              Run Appweb in debug mode and disable all timeouts. This disables
              request and session timeouts.  The -d option  is  an  alias  for
              --debug.

       --exe path
              Set  the  path  to  the appweb.exe executable image. This may be
              required on VxWorks so that Appweb can load  modules  which  are
              located   at  "appweb.exe/../lib".  This  is  necessary  because
              VxWorks cannot determine the path to  the  executable  image  at
              runtime.

       --log logSpec
              Name the Appweb log file. This will override the ErrorLog direc-
              tive in the  configuration  file.   When  the  maximum  size  is
              exceeded,  the log file will be rotated to logName.old and a new
              log file will be started. The -l option is an alias  for  --log.
              The syntax is:

              --log logName[:logLevel][.maxSize]

       --home directory
              Define the server home directory for Appweb.

       --name NAME
              Define  a unique name for this instance of Appweb. Useful for ps
              -ef listings.

       --verbose
              Shorthand for --log stdout:4. The -v  option  is  an  alias  for
              --verbose.

       --version
              Output the product version number.
