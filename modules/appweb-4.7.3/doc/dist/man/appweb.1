.SH DESCRIPTION
Appweb is a compact embedded HTTP web server.  It is a fast, small-footprint, multi-threaded, standards-based, 
portable server developed for use by embedded devices and applications.  It can run as a stand-alone 
web server or the Appweb library can be embedded in applications. 
.P
Appweb supports HTTP/1.1, SSL, digest and basic authentication, virtual hosting, ranged requests, chunked transfers, 
file upload and security limits.  Appweb has an Apache style configuration file and supports the PHP and Ejscript 
web frameworks. 
.P
Appweb normally reads the \fBappweb.conf\fR file for configuration directives. However, if appweb is invoked with 
an IP address or port number on the command line, Appweb will not read the configuration file. Rather it will
listen for requests on the specified IP:PORT address. If the PORT component is omitted, Appweb will listen
on port 80. If the IP address is omitted and a port is supplied, Appweb will listen on all network interfaces.
.P
Appweb responds to the SIGUSR2 signal and toggles the trace level from 2 to 4 and vice-versa. Appweb responds to the
SIGINFO|SIGPWR signal and emits operational stats to the trace log.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\--config filename\fR
Define the name of the Appweb configuration file. This is by default \fBappweb\fR.
.TP
\fB\--chroot directory\fR
Change the system root directory for Appweb. This creates a chroot jail so that the Appweb process cannot access
any files outside the given directory.
.TP
\fB\--debugger\fR
Run Appweb in debug mode and disable all timeouts. This disables request and session timeouts.
The \fB-d\fR option is an alias for --debug.
.TP
\fB\--exe path\fR
Set the path to the appweb.exe executable image. This may be required on VxWorks so that Appweb can 
load modules which are located at "appweb.exe/../lib". This is necessary because VxWorks cannot determine
the path to the executable image at runtime.
.TP
\fB\--log logSpec\fR
Name the Appweb log file. This will override the ErrorLog directive 
in the configuration file.  When the maximum size is exceeded, the log file will be rotated to logName.old 
and a new log file will be started. The \fB-l\fR option is an alias for --log.
The syntax is: 
.PP
.RS 6
 --log logName[:logLevel][.maxSize]
.RE
.TP
\fB\--home directory\fR
Define the server home directory for Appweb.
.TP
\fB\--name NAME\fR
Define a unique name for this instance of Appweb. Useful for ps -ef listings.
.TP
\fB\--verbose\fR
Shorthand for --log stdout:4. The \fB-v\fR option is an alias for --verbose.
.TP
\fB\--version\fR
Output the product version number.
