.SH DESCRIPTION
The manager program is used to configure the running of system services (daemons).
Manager provides a generic way to install/uninstall, enable/disable, start/stop, and run a service, regardless
of the operating system. When used to run a service, it starts the service and then watches over it, to restart it 
should it fail. Manager also provides general management commands to enable, disable, start, and stop appweb. 
.SH COMMANDS

.TP

.TP
\fBinstall\fR

Arguments to use for the service program command line when it starts.
.TP
\fB\--console\fR
Windows specific option to allow the manager process to interact with the users desktop.
.TP
\fB\--daemon\fR
Run the manager as a daemon process. This causes the manager to detach from the current shell and run in the background.
.TP
\fB\--heartBeat interval\fR
Windows specific option to set the frequency in seconds for the manager to check on service. 
This period should be short enough that the service will
be quickly restarted should it fail, but not so short that the manager process consumes significant CPU resources.
If the service dies more than 30 times per hour, the manager will suspend restarting the service.

\fB\--home directory\fR
Set the home directory in which to start the service.
.TP

most verbose.
