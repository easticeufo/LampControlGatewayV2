            <h1>Porting Appweb</h1>
            <p>Porting any software is not for the novice. It requires considerable skill to read another person's code
            and adapt it to a new environment. These instructions are intended for experienced developers who want to
            port Appweb to a new operating system or processor architecture.</p>
            <p>Appweb has been written to maximize the ease of porting to a new environment. The O/S and
            processor-dependent code have been contained while the bulk of the code is cross-platform. Most of this
            dependent code is under the <b>src/deps/mpr</b> sub-directory which represents the Multithreaded Portable
            Runtime (MPR).</p>
            <p><b>NOTE:</b> When attempting a port, you should get the latest copy of the development source 
            rather than using the download source package. You can get the latest development source by checking out a
            copy from the <a href="https://github.com/embedthis/appweb">repository</a>.</p>
            <p><b>NOTE:</b> Please read <a href="building.html">Building from Source</a> before your read this
            document. It provides valuable background about building from source.</p>

            <h2>Steps in Porting to a new Operating System</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Pick a Name for the O/S</h3>
                    <p>If you are doing a port for a new operating system, you need to pick a symbolic name that will
                    be used in conditional compilation, Makefiles, MakeMe files, and operating system specific 
                    directories. Some existing O/S names are: "linux", "windows", "freebsd", and "macosx".</p>
                    <p>These names are used as upper-case pre-processor defines and in some cases as lower-case
                        directory names.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Select the base O/S to Copy</h3>
                    <p>The easiest way to port to a new O/S is to find the closest existing supported O/S that the
                    Appweb software already supports and use it as a base to modify. For example, if you are porting to
                    QNX, you may want to use the Linux port as a base.</p></li>
                <li><h3>Create the output products directory</h3>
                    <p>You need to create a directory for the build products: objects, binaries etc. This should 
                    be named OS-ARCH-PROFILE. For example: qnx-x86-debug. Under this directory create the inc, bin and 
                    obj directories.</p>
                    <pre>
mkdir -p qnx-x86-debug/bin qnx-x86-debug/obj qnx-x86-debug/inc
</pre>
                <li><h3>Create the Makefile</h3>
                <p>Create the Makefile by copying the makefile for the similar O/S. i.e. in our example, 
                Copy the projects/appweb-linux.mk Makefile to projects/appweb-qnx.mk. Then edit the
                appropriate compiler and linker switches. Edit the top level Makefile if required to chain to this
                    new Makefile.</p>
                    <pre>
cp projects/appweb-linux.mk projects/appweb-qnx.mk
vi projects/appweb-qnx.mk
</pre>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Tailor the cross-platform O/S header.</h3>
                    <p>To insulate most of the Appweb source code from the differences of various operating systems,
                    the <em>src/paks/osdep/osdep.h</em> header file wraps all the required O/S headers and publishes a
                    consistent set of types and prototypes. None of the source files include normal O/S headers like
                    &lt;string.h&gt;. While this does slow the build by including more headers than are required
                    &mdash; it is barely noticeable on modern CPUs.</p>
                    <p>When porting the osdep.h, start by copying the sections in osdep.h that pertain to your base 
                    copied O/S.
                    These will be protected by "#if BASEOS" defines. In the example of QNX, we would look for, and
                    copy, any sections with "#if LINUX" and create "#if QNX" sections.</p>
                    <p><b>DO NOT</b> introduce conditional code in other O/S sections. It is better to copy the entire
                    contents from the base O/S and modify. It is better to isolate the code for each O/S.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Test the Headers with a Hello World Program.</h3>
                    <p>Don't use the make system yet. Just create an empty C hello world program and include "osdep.h".
                    Compile it and shake out the issues. </p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Port the MPR Source Code</h3>
                <p>The Multithreaded Portable Runtime (MPR) wraps the operating system services and exposes
                    a portable, consistent interface for Appweb to utilize. 
                    So now is the time for the real work. You will need to modify the mprLib.c file to support your
                    new platform.
                    In mprLib.c, you will see banners marking where the various sub-files have been catenated together.
                    The main sections to modify will be socket.c, thread.c time.c and wait.c. Search for conditional
                    code sections for your base O/S and copy/modify as appropriate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Test Compile the Mpr</h3>
                    <p>To start out, test compile just the MPR library. </p>
                    <pre>
make NEWOS-ARCH-debug/obj/mprLib.o
</pre>
                    <p>At this stage of the porting effort, the <b>make</b> command will undoubtedly provoke a stream
                    of errors. Use this to work out the bugs in mpr.h and mprLib.c for your O/S.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Compile the Rest</h3>
                    <p>After the MPR, it is more downhill. The rest of the code should compile and build more easily. 
                    It is quite cross-platform.</p>
                    <pre>
make
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Test Appweb</h3>
                    <pre>
cd test
appweb -v
</pre>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="section">Working with the Appweb Development Team</h2>
            <p>Once you have a basic port running, you should send it back for the team to look over. They can provide
            advice and suggestions. At the first opportunity, your changes may be merged back into the development tree
            so others can benefit from your work.</p>
            <p>Good luck and have fun. Please give feedback to the development team at <a href=
            "mailto:dev@embedthis.com">dev@embedthis.com</a>.</p>
