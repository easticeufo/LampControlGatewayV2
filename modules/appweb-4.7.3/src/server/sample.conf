#   sample.conf -- Sample (Maximal) Configuration for the Embedthis Appweb HTTP Server
#   
#   This sample demonstrates many directives that can be used in an appweb.conf file.
#   Do not use this file directly, it is too verbose. Rather cut the sections you need
#   into your own, minimal configuration file.

#
#   Server home directory for Appweb to find configuration files. 
#   Appweb will change directory to this location when it runs.
#
#   Home "."

#
#   Define the logging configuration first so any errors are logged.
#   This is for errors and debug trace. This log file is for the whole
#   server including virtual hosts. Add a timestamp every 1 hour.
#   This is overridden by appweb command line args: -v and --log.
#
ErrorLog "error.log" size=10MB level=2 backup=5 append anew stamp=1hr

#
#   Control the tracing of request and response requests to the error log.
#   This directive defines the levels at which various events are logged.
#
#   Log rx conn=5 first=2 headers=3 body=5 limits=5 size=10K
#   Log tx first=3 headers=3 body=5 limits=5 time=6 size=10K exclude="jpg,gif,png,ico,css,js"

#
#   The user name and group to become. The fake name APPWEB will change
#   user/group to the Appweb default user/group if running as root/adminstrator.
#   This is www on MAC, nobody/nogroup on Linux, and administrator on Windows. 
#   The fake name _unchanged_ means don't change the user or group. 
#   NOTE: ESP and EJS require write access to the cache directory If you wish to 
#   backup log files, you must have write permission to the log file directory.

#
#   Create a "chroot jail" by changing the system root directory to this
#   directory. Once changed files outside the jail will be inaccessible.
#   If rotating log files, must do Chroot before defining logs.
#   You may need to make directories accessible inside the jail. 
#
#   MakeDir APPWEB:APPWEB:0755 /var/spool/appweb/embedthis/cache
#   Chroot "."

#
#   Bind Appweb to listen for incoming requests on this address. Formats 
#   include (IP, IP:PORT, PORT). If an IP address is omitted, Appweb will 
#   listen on all interfaces. If a port is omitted, then port 80 is used.
#   If the O/S has a dual-stack network, then connections on both IPv4 and 
#   IPv6 will be accepted. Use [::]:port to explicitly listen to only IPv6 
#   requests. [::1] is the IPv6 loopback. Use 0.0.0.0:port to listen to only 
#   IPv4 requests. This directive may be specified via the include.conf above.
#
Listen 80

#
#   Name of the server to use for redirects and error responses to clients. 
#   Uncomment this line and replace it with the public name of your server. 
#   This host name and port do not get used for listening on sockets. If 
#   unspecified, Appweb will use the IP address for the host name.
#   NOTE: Only define a ServerName if you are not using a ListenSecure
#   directive for SSL. Otherwise, redirects will always go to the address
#   you define here regardless of http or https. If you need to use a 
#   ServerName with SSL, use a VirtualHost to define your SSL endpoint.
#
#   ServerName http://example.com

#
#   Location for documents for the primary server host. Routes and virtual
#   hosts may define their own document root.
#   This directive may be specified via the include.conf above.
#
Documents ./web

#
#   Search path for dynamically loadable modules. If modules have been 
#   statically linked into Appweb, this directive and LoadModule directives
#   will be ignored. This directive must be before any LoadModule directives.
#   The default path is: dir-containing-executable : /usr/lib/appweb/bin
#   Use ";" as a separator on windows.

#
#   Notes on the request processing pipeline. The pipeline consists of a set 
#   of stages comprised of a handler, possible filters and one network 
#   connector. 
#
#   The request processing pipeline can be configured at various levels: 
#   globally, virtual hosts and location blocks. At each level, a set of 
#   processing stages can be defined. Inner levels inherit the pipeline from 
#   the outer levels. The pipeline can be reset at a level by using 
#   "Reset pipeline". Each stage may be defined for all requests or only for a 
#   specific file extension or location path prefix.
#
#   If you use the AddConnector, AddFilter or AddHandler directives, the 
#   stage is defined for both input and output processing. For filters you can
#   use AddInputFilter AddOutputFilter directives to define for a single 
#   direction.
#
#   Multiple handlers can be defined, but only the first matching handler will
#   be activated when a request is processed.
#

#
#   Select the fileHandler for static files and as a catch-all.
#

#
#   Enable the uploadFilter if you want Appweb to transparently accept upload
#   data. Handlers receive form variables that refer to the uploaded file. 
#   Most PHP apps require the uploadFilter to be disabled.
#   SECURITY NOTE: Check the LimitUpload to cap the maximum upload. 
#   SECURITY NOTE: Good to use the upload filter inside a route.
