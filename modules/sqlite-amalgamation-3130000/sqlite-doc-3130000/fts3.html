<h2 style="margin-left:1.0em">  Overview</h2>

<p>
  FTS3 and FTS4 are SQLite virtual table modules that allows users to perform 
  full-text searches on a set of documents. The most common (and effective) 
  way to describe full-text searches is "what Google, Yahoo, and Bing do
  with documents placed on the World Wide Web". Users input a term, or series 
  of terms, perhaps connected by a binary operator or grouped together into a 
  phrase, and the full-text query system finds the set of documents that best 
  matches those terms considering the operators and groupings the user has 
  specified. This article describes the deployment and usage of FTS3 and FTS4.

<p>
  FTS1 and FTS2 are obsolete full-text search modules for SQLite.  There are known
  issues with these older modules and their use should be avoided.
  Portions of the original FTS3 code were contributed to the SQLite project 
  by Scott Hess of <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>. It is now 
  developed and maintained as part of SQLite.

<h1 id="section_1">1. Introduction to FTS3 and FTS4</h1>

<p>
  The FTS3 and FTS4 extension modules allows users to create special tables with a 
  built-in full-text index (hereafter "FTS tables"). The full-text index
  allows the user to efficiently query the database for all rows that contain
  one or more words (hereafter "tokens"), even if the table
  contains many large documents.

<p>
  For example, if each of the 517430 documents in the 
  "<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/">Enron E-Mail Dataset</a>"
  is inserted into both an FTS table and an ordinary SQLite table
  created using the following SQL script:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE enrondata1 USING fts3(content TEXT);     /* FTS3 table */
CREATE TABLE enrondata2(content TEXT);                        /* Ordinary table */
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  Then either of the two queries below may be executed to find the number of
  documents in the database that contain the word "linux" (351). Using one
  desktop PC hardware configuration, the query on the FTS3 table returns in
  approximately 0.03 seconds, versus 22.5 for querying the ordinary table.

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">SELECT count(*) FROM enrondata1 WHERE content MATCH 'linux';  /* 0.03 seconds */
SELECT count(*) FROM enrondata2 WHERE content LIKE '%linux%'; /* 22.5 seconds */
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  Of course, the two queries above are not entirely equivalent. For example
  the LIKE query matches rows that contain terms such as "linuxophobe"
  or "EnterpriseLinux" (as it happens, the Enron E-Mail Dataset does not
  actually contain any such terms), whereas the MATCH query on the FTS3 table
  selects only those rows that contain "linux" as a discrete token. Both 
  searches are case-insensitive. The FTS3 table consumes around 2006 MB on
  disk compared to just 1453 MB for the ordinary table. Using the same
  hardware configuration used to perform the SELECT queries above, the FTS3
  table took just under 31 minutes to populate, versus 25 for the ordinary
  table.

<h2 id="section_1_1">1.1. Differences between FTS3 and FTS4</h2>
<a name="fts4"></a>


<p>
  FTS3 and FTS4 are nearly identical. They share most of their code in common,
  and their interfaces are the same. The differences are:

<ul>
  <li> <p>FTS4 contains query performance optimizations that may significantly
       improve the performance of full-text queries that contain terms that are
       very common (present in a large percentage of table rows).

  <li> <p>FTS4 supports some additional options that may used with the <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo">matchinfo()</a>
       function. 

  <li> <p>Because it stores extra information on disk in two new 
       <a href="fts3.html#*shadowtab">shadow tables</a> in order to support the performance
       optimizations and extra matchinfo() options, FTS4 tables may consume more
       disk space than the equivalent table created using FTS3. Usually the overhead
       is 1-2% or less, but may be as high as 10% if the documents stored in the
       FTS table are very small. The overhead may be reduced by specifying the
       directive <a href="fts3.html#fts4matchinfo">"matchinfo=fts3"</a> as part of the FTS4 table
       declaration, but this comes at the expense of sacrificing some of the
       extra supported matchinfo() options.

  <li> <p>FTS4 provides hooks (the compress and uncompress 
       <a href="fts3.html#fts4_options">options</a>) allowing data to be stored in a compressed 
       form, reducing disk usage and IO.
</ul>

<p>
  FTS4 is an enhancement to FTS3.  FTS3 has been available since SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_5_0.html">version 3.5.0</a> in
  2007-09-04.  The enhancements for FTS4 were added with SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_4.html">version 3.7.4</a> on 2010-12-08.

<p>
  Which module, FTS3 or FTS4, should you use in your application?  FTS4 is
  sometimes significantly faster than FTS3, even orders of magnitude faster
  depending on the query, though in the common case the performance of the two
  modules is similar. FTS4 also offers the enhanced <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo">matchinfo()</a> outputs which
  can be useful in ranking the results of a <a href="fts3.html#section_3">MATCH</a> operation.  On the
  other hand, in the absence of a <a href="fts3.html#fts4matchinfo">matchinfo=fts3</a> directive FTS4 requires a little
  more disk space than FTS3, though only a percent of two in most cases.

<p>
  For newer applications, FTS4 is recommended; though if compatibility with older 
  versions of SQLite is important, then FTS3 will usually serve just as well.  

<h2 id="section_1_2">1.2. Creating and Destroying FTS Tables</h2>

<p>
  Like other virtual table types, new FTS tables are created using a 
  <a href="lang_createvtab.html">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE</a> statement. The module name, which follows
  the USING keyword, is either "fts3" or "fts4". The virtual table module arguments may
  be left empty, in which case an FTS table with a single user-defined 
  column named "content" is created. Alternatively, the module arguments
  may be passed a list of comma separated column names. 

<p>
  If column names are explicitly provided for the FTS table as part of
  the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement, then a datatype name may be optionally 
  specified for each column. This is pure syntactic sugar, the
  supplied typenames are not used by FTS or the SQLite core for any
  purpose. The same applies to any constraints specified along with an
  FTS column name - they are parsed but not used or recorded by the system
  in any way.

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create an FTS table named "data" with one column - "content":</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE data USING fts3();

<i>-- Create an FTS table named "pages" with three columns:</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE pages USING fts4(title, keywords, body);

<i>-- Create an FTS table named "mail" with two columns. Datatypes
-- and column constraints are specified along with each column. These
-- are completely ignored by FTS and SQLite. </i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE mail USING fts3(
  subject VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
  body TEXT CHECK(length(body)&lt;10240)
);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  As well as a list of columns, the module arguments passed to a CREATE
  VIRTUAL TABLE statement used to create an FTS table may be used to specify
  a <a href="fts3.html#tokenizer">tokenizer</a>. This is done by specifying a string of the form
  "tokenize=&lt;tokenizer name&gt; &lt;tokenizer args&gt;" in place of a column
  name, where &lt;tokenizer name&gt; is the name of the tokenizer to use and
  &lt;tokenizer args&gt; is an optional list of whitespace separated qualifiers
  to pass to the tokenizer implementation. A tokenizer specification may be
  placed anywhere in the column list, but at most one tokenizer declaration is
  allowed for each CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement. <a href="fts3.html#tokenizer">See below</a> for a 
  detailed description of using (and, if necessary, implementing) a tokenizer.

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create an FTS table named "papers" with two columns that uses</i>
<i>-- the tokenizer "porter".</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts3(author, document, tokenize=porter);

<i>-- Create an FTS table with a single column - "content" - that uses</i>
<i>-- the "simple" tokenizer.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE data USING fts4(tokenize=simple);

<i>-- Create an FTS table with two columns that uses the "icu" tokenizer.</i>
<i>-- The qualifier "en_AU" is passed to the tokenizer implementation</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE names USING fts3(a, b, tokenize=icu en_AU);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  FTS tables may be dropped from the database using an ordinary <a href="lang_droptable.html">DROP TABLE</a>
  statement. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create, then immediately drop, an FTS4 table.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE data USING fts4();
DROP TABLE data;
</pre></table></div>

<h2 id="section_1_3">1.3. Populating FTS Tables</h2>

  <p>
    FTS tables are populated using <a href="lang_insert.html">INSERT</a>, <a href="lang_update.html">UPDATE</a> and <a href="lang_delete.html">DELETE</a>
    statements in the same way as ordinary SQLite tables are.

  <p>
    As well as the columns named by the user (or the "content" column if no
    module arguments were specified as part of the <a href="lang_createvtab.html">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE</a> 
    statement), each FTS table has a "rowid" column. The rowid of an FTS
    table behaves in the same way as the rowid column of an ordinary SQLite 
    table, except that the values stored in the rowid column of an FTS table 
    remain unchanged if the database is rebuilt using the <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a> command. 
    For FTS tables, "docid" is allowed as an alias along with the usual "rowid",
    "oid" and "_oid_" identifiers. Attempting to insert or update a row with a 
    docid value that already exists in the table is an error, just as it would 
    be with an ordinary SQLite table.

  <p>
    There is one other subtle difference between "docid" and the normal SQLite
    aliases for the rowid column. Normally, if an INSERT or UPDATE statement 
    assigns discrete values to two or more aliases of the rowid column, SQLite 
    writes the rightmost of such values specified in the INSERT or UPDATE
    statement to the database. However, assigning a non-NULL value to both
    the "docid" and one or more of the SQLite rowid aliases when inserting or
    updating an FTS table is considered an error. See below for an example.

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create an FTS table</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE pages USING fts4(title, body);

<i>-- Insert a row with a specific docid value.</i>
INSERT INTO pages(docid, title, body) VALUES(53, 'Home Page', 'SQLite is a software...');

<i>-- Insert a row and allow FTS to assign a docid value using the same algorithm as</i>
<i>-- SQLite uses for ordinary tables. In this case the new docid will be 54,</i>
<i>-- one greater than the largest docid currently present in the table.</i>
INSERT INTO pages(title, body) VALUES('Download', 'All SQLite source code...');

<i>-- Change the title of the row just inserted.</i>
UPDATE pages SET title = 'Download SQLite' WHERE rowid = 54;

<i>-- Delete the entire table contents.</i>
DELETE FROM pages;

<i>-- The following is an error. It is not possible to assign non-NULL values to both</i>
<i>-- the rowid and docid columns of an FTS table.</i>
INSERT INTO pages(rowid, docid, title, body) VALUES(1, 2, 'A title', 'A document body');
</pre></table></div>

  <p>
    To support full-text queries, FTS maintains an inverted index that maps
    from each unique term or word that appears in the dataset to the locations
    in which it appears within the table contents. For the curious, a 
    complete description of the <a href="fts3.html#section_9">data structure</a> used to store
    this index within the database file appears below. A feature of
    this data structure is that at any time the database may contain not
    one index b-tree, but several different b-trees that are incrementally
    merged as rows are inserted, updated and deleted. This technique improves 
    performance when writing to an FTS table, but causes some overhead for
    full-text queries that use the index. Evaluating the special <a href="fts3.html#*fts4optcmd">"optimize" command</a>, 
    an SQL statement of the
    form "INSERT INTO &lt;fts-table&gt;(&lt;fts-table&gt;) VALUES('optimize')",
    causes FTS to merge all existing index b-trees into a single large
    b-tree containing the entire index. This can be an expensive operation,
    but may speed up future queries. 

  <p>
    For example, to optimize the full-text index for an FTS table named
    "docs":

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Optimize the internal structure of FTS table "docs".</i>
INSERT INTO docs(docs) VALUES('optimize');
</pre></table></div>

  <p>
    The statement above may appear syntactically incorrect to some. Refer to
    the section describing the <a href="fts3.html#section_1_4">simple fts queries</a> for an explanation.

  <p>
    There is another, deprecated, method for invoking the optimize 
    operation using a SELECT statement. New code should use statements
    similar to the INSERT above to optimize FTS structures.

<a name="section_1_4"></a>
<h2 id="section_1_4">1.4. Simple FTS Queries</h2>

<p>
  As for all other SQLite tables, virtual or otherwise, data is retrieved
  from FTS tables using a <a href="lang_select.html">SELECT</a> statement.

<p>
  FTS tables can be queried efficiently using SELECT statements of two
  different forms:

<ul>
  <li><p>
    <b>Query by rowid</b>. If the WHERE clause of the SELECT statement
    contains a sub-clause of the form "rowid = ?", where ? is an SQL expression,
    FTS is able to retrieve the requested row directly using the equivalent 
    of an SQLite <a href="lang_createtable.html#rowid">INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</a> index.

  <li><p>
    <b>Full-text query</b>. If the WHERE clause of the SELECT statement contains
    a sub-clause of the form "&lt;column&gt; MATCH ?", FTS is able to use 
    the built-in full-text index to restrict the search to those documents 
    that match the full-text query string specified as the right-hand operand
    of the MATCH clause.
</ul>

<p>
  If neither of these two query strategies can be used, all
  queries on FTS tables are implemented using a linear scan of the entire
  table. If the table contains large amounts of data, this may be an 
  impractical approach (the first example on this page shows that a linear
  scan of 1.5 GB of data takes around 30 seconds using a modern PC).

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- The examples in this block assume the following FTS table:</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE mail USING fts3(subject, body);

SELECT * FROM mail WHERE rowid = 15;                <i>-- Fast. Rowid lookup.</i>
SELECT * FROM mail WHERE body MATCH 'sqlite';       <i>-- Fast. Full-text query.</i>
SELECT * FROM mail WHERE mail MATCH 'search';       <i>-- Fast. Full-text query.</i>
SELECT * FROM mail WHERE rowid BETWEEN 15 AND 20;   <i>-- Slow. Linear scan.</i>
SELECT * FROM mail WHERE subject = 'database';      <i>-- Slow. Linear scan.</i>
SELECT * FROM mail WHERE subject MATCH 'database';  <i>-- Fast. Full-text query.</i>
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  In all of the full-text queries above, the right-hand operand of the MATCH
  operator is a string consisting of a single term. In this case, the MATCH
  expression evaluates to true for all documents that contain one or more 
  instances of the specified word ("sqlite", "search" or "database", depending 
  on which example you look at). Specifying a single term as the right-hand
  operand of the MATCH operator results in the simplest and most common type 
  of full-text query possible. However more complicated queries are possible,
  including phrase searches, term-prefix searches and searches for documents 
  containing combinations of terms occurring within a defined proximity of each
  other. The various ways in which the full-text index may be queried are
  <a href="fts3.html#section_3">described below</a>.

<p>
  Normally, full-text queries are case-insensitive. However, this
  is dependent on the specific <a href="fts3.html#tokenizer">tokenizer</a> used by the FTS table
  being queried. Refer to the section on <a href="fts3.html#tokenizer">tokenizers</a> for details.

<p>
  The paragraph above notes that a MATCH operator with a simple term as the
  right-hand operand evaluates to true for all documents that contain the
  specified term. In this context, the "document" may refer to either the 
  data stored in a single column of a row of an FTS table, or to the contents
  of all columns in a single row, depending on the identifier used as the
  left-hand operand to the MATCH operator. If the identifier specified as
  the left-hand operand of the MATCH operator is an FTS table column name,
  then the document that the search term must be contained in is the value
  stored in the specified column. However, if the identifier is the name
  of the FTS <i>table</i> itself, then the MATCH operator evaluates to true
  for each row of the FTS table for which any column contains the search 
  term. The following example demonstrates this:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Example schema</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE mail USING fts3(subject, body);

<i>-- Example table population</i>
INSERT INTO mail(docid, subject, body) VALUES(1, 'software feedback', 'found it too slow');
INSERT INTO mail(docid, subject, body) VALUES(2, 'software feedback', 'no feedback');
INSERT INTO mail(docid, subject, body) VALUES(3, 'slow lunch order',  'was a software problem');

<i>-- Example queries</i>
SELECT * FROM mail WHERE subject MATCH 'software';    <i>-- Selects rows 1 and 2</i>
SELECT * FROM mail WHERE body    MATCH 'feedback';    <i>-- Selects row 2</i>
SELECT * FROM mail WHERE mail    MATCH 'software';    <i>-- Selects rows 1, 2 and 3</i>
SELECT * FROM mail WHERE mail    MATCH 'slow';        <i>-- Selects rows 1 and 3</i>
</pre></table></div>
  
<p>
  At first glance, the final two full-text queries in the example above seem
  to be syntactically incorrect, as there is a table name ("mail") used as
  an SQL expression. The reason this is acceptable is that each FTS table
  actually has a <a href="c3ref/declare_vtab.html">HIDDEN</a> column with the same name
  as the table itself (in this case, "mail"). The value stored in this
  column is not meaningful to the application, but can be used as the 
  left-hand operand to a MATCH operator. This special column may also be
  passed as an argument to the <a href="fts3.html#snippet">FTS auxiliary functions</a>.

<p>
  The following example illustrates the above. The expressions "docs", 
  "docs.docs" and "main.docs.docs" all refer to column "docs". However, the 
  expression "main.docs" does not refer to any column. It could be used to 
  refer to a table, but a table name is not allowed in the context in which
  it is used below.

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Example schema</i>

<h2 id="section_1_5">1.5. Summary</h2>

<p>
  From the users point of view, FTS tables are similar to ordinary SQLite
  tables in many ways. Data may be added to, modified within and removed 
  from FTS tables using the INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE commands just as 
  it may be with ordinary tables. Similarly, the SELECT command may be used 
  to query data. The following list summarizes the differences between FTS
  and ordinary tables:

<ol>
  <li><p> 
    As with all virtual table types, it is not possible to create indices or
    triggers attached to FTS tables. Nor is it possible to use the ALTER TABLE
    command to add extra columns to FTS tables (although it is possible to use
    ALTER TABLE to rename an FTS table).

  <li><p> 
    Data-types specified as part of the "CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE" statement
    used to create an FTS table are ignored completely. Instead of the
    normal rules for applying type <a href="datatype3.html#affinity">affinity</a> to inserted values, all
    values inserted into FTS table columns (except the special rowid
    column) are converted to type TEXT before being stored.

  <li><p> 
    FTS tables permit the special alias "docid" to be used to refer to the
    rowid column supported by all <a href="vtab.html">virtual tables</a>.

  <li><p> 
    The <a href="fts3.html#section_3">FTS MATCH</a> operator is supported for queries based on the built-in
    full-text index. 

  <li><p> 
    The <a href="fts3.html#snippet">FTS auxiliary functions</a>, <a href="fts3.html#snippet">snippet()</a>, <a href="fts3.html#offsets">offsets()</a>, and <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo">matchinfo()</a> are 
    available to support full-text queries.

  <li><p>
    <a name="hiddencol"></a>

    Every FTS table has a <a href="vtab.html#hiddencol">hidden column</a> with the 
    same name as the table itself. The value contained in each row for the
    hidden column is a blob that is only useful as the left operand of a
    <a href="fts3.html#section_3">MATCH</a> operator, or as the left-most argument to one
    of the <a href="fts3.html#snippet">FTS auxiliary functions</a>.
    

</ol>


<a name="section_2"></a>
<h1 id="section_2">2. Compiling and Enabling FTS3 and FTS4</h1>

<p>
  Although FTS3 and FTS4 are included with the SQLite core source code, they are not
  enabled by default. To build SQLite with FTS functionality enabled, define
  the preprocessor macro <a href="compile.html#enable_fts3">SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3</a> when compiling. New applications
  should also define the <a href="compile.html#enable_fts3_parenthesis">SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS</a> macro to enable the
  <a href="fts3.html#section_3_1">enhanced query syntax</a> (see below). Usually, this is done by adding the 
  following two switches to the compiler command line:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3
-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  Note that enabling FTS3 also makes FTS4 available.  There is not a separate
  SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4 compile-time option.  A build of SQLite either supports
  both FTS3 and FTS4 or it supports neither.

<p>
  If using the amalgamation autoconf based build system, setting the CPPFLAGS
  environment variable while running the 'configure' script is an easy
  way to set these macros. For example, the following command:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CPPFLAGS="-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3 -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS" ./configure &lt;configure options&gt;
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  where <i>&lt;configure options&gt;</i> are those options normally passed to
  the configure script, if any.

<p>
  Because FTS3 and FTS4 are virtual tables, The <a href="compile.html#enable_fts3">SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3</a> compile-time option
  is incompatible with the <a href="compile.html#omit_virtualtable">SQLITE_OMIT_VIRTUALTABLE</a> option.

<p>
  If a build of SQLite does not include the FTS modules, then any attempt to prepare an
  SQL statement to create an FTS3 or FTS4 table or to drop or access an existing 
  FTS table in any way will fail. The error message returned will be similar 
  to "no such module: ftsN" (where N is either 3 or 4).

<p>
  If the C version of the <a href="http://site.icu-project.org/">ICU library</a>
  is available, then FTS may also be compiled with the SQLITE_ENABLE_ICU
  pre-processor macro defined. Compiling with this macro enables an FTS
  <a href="fts3.html#tokenizer">tokenizer</a> that uses the ICU library to split a document into terms
  (words) using the conventions for a specified language and locale.

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">-DSQLITE_ENABLE_ICU
</pre></table></div>
  

<a name="section_3"></a>
<h1 id="section_3">3. Full-text Index Queries</h1>

<p>
  The most useful thing about FTS tables is the queries that may be 
  performed using the built-in full-text index. Full-text queries are 
  performed by specifying a clause of the form 
  "&lt;column&gt; MATCH &lt;full-text query expression&gt;" as part of the WHERE 
  clause of a SELECT statement that reads data from an FTS table. 
  <a href="fts3.html#section_1_4">Simple FTS queries</a> that return all documents that 
  contain a given term are described above. In that discussion the right-hand
  operand of the MATCH operator was assumed to be a string consisting of a
  single term. This section describes the more complex query types supported 
  by FTS tables, and how they may be utilized by specifying a more
  complex query expression as the right-hand operand of a MATCH operator.

<p>
  FTS tables support three basic query types:

<ul>
  <a name="termprefix"></a>

  <li><p><b>Token or token prefix queries</b>. 
    An FTS table may be queried for all documents that contain a specified
    term (the <a href="fts3.html#section_1_4">simple case</a> described above), or for
    all documents that contain a term with a specified prefix. As we have
    seen, the query expression for a specific term is simply the term itself.
    The query expression used to search for a term prefix is the prefix
    itself with a '*' character appended to it. For example:
</ul>

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Virtual table declaration</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE docs USING fts3(title, body);

<i>-- Query for all documents containing the term "linux":</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'linux';

<i>-- Query for all documents containing a term with the prefix "lin". This will match</i>
<i>-- all documents that contain "linux", but also those that contain terms "linear",</i>
<i>--"linker", "linguistic" and so on.</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'lin*';
</pre></table></div>

<ul>
  <li style="list-style:none"><p>
    Normally, a token or token prefix query is matched against the FTS table 
    column specified as the right-hand side of the MATCH operator. Or, if the
    special column with the same name as the FTS table itself is specified,
    against all columns. This may be overridden by specifying a column-name
    followed by a ":" character before a basic term query. There may be space
    between the ":" and the term to query for, but not between the column-name
    and the ":" character. For example:
</ul>
   
<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Query the database for documents for which the term "linux" appears in</i>
<i>-- the document title, and the term "problems" appears in either the title</i>
<i>-- or body of the document.</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'title:linux problems';

<i>-- Query the database for documents for which the term "linux" appears in</i>
<i>-- the document title, and the term "driver" appears in the body of the document</i>
<i>-- ("driver" may also appear in the title, but this alone will not satisfy the</i>.
<i>-- query criteria).</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE body MATCH 'title:linux driver';
</pre></table></div>

<ul>
  <li style="list-style:none"><p>
    If the FTS table is an FTS4 table (not FTS3), a token may also be prefixed
    with a "&#94;" character. In this case, in order to match the token must
    appear as the very first token in any column of the matching row. Examples:
</ul>

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- All documents for which "linux" is the first token of at least one</i>
<i>-- column.</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH '&#94;linux';

<i>-- All documents for which the first token in column "title" begins with "lin".</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE body MATCH 'title: &#94;lin*';
</pre></table></div>

<a name="phrase"></a>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Phrase queries</b>.
    A phrase query is a query that retrieves all documents that contain a
    nominated set of terms or term prefixes in a specified order with no
    intervening tokens. Phrase queries are specified by enclosing a space
    separated sequence of terms or term prefixes in double quotes (").
    For example:
</ul>

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Query for all documents that contain the phrase "linux applications".</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH '"linux applications"';

<i>-- Query for all documents that contain a phrase that matches "lin* app*". As well as</i>
<i>-- "linux applications", this will match common phrases such as "linoleum appliances"</i>
<i>-- or "link apprentice".</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH '"lin* app*"';
</pre></table></div>

<a name="near"></a>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>NEAR queries</b>. 
    A NEAR query is a query that returns documents that contain a two or
    more nominated terms or phrases within a specified proximity of each 
    other (by default with 10 or less intervening terms). A NEAR query is 
    specified by putting the keyword "NEAR" between two phrase, term or 
    <a href="fts3.html#termprefix">prefix queries</a>. To specify a proximity other than the default,
    an operator of the form "NEAR/<i>&lt;N&gt;</i>" may be used, where
    <i>&lt;N&gt;</i> is the maximum number of intervening terms allowed.
    For example:
</ul>

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Virtual table declaration.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE docs USING fts4();

<i>-- Virtual table data.</i>
INSERT INTO docs VALUES('SQLite is an ACID compliant embedded relational database management system');

<i>-- Search for a document that contains the terms "sqlite" and "database" with</i>
<i>-- not more than 10 intervening terms. This matches the only document in</i>
<i>-- table docs (since there are only six terms between "SQLite" and "database"</i> 
<i>-- in the document)</i>.
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'sqlite NEAR database';

<i>-- Search for a document that contains the terms "sqlite" and "database" with</i>
<i>-- not more than 6 intervening terms. This also matches the only document in</i>
<i>-- table docs. Note that the order in which the terms appear in the document</i>
<i>-- does not have to be the same as the order in which they appear in the query.</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'database NEAR/6 sqlite';

<i>-- Search for a document that contains the terms "sqlite" and "database" with</i>
<i>-- not more than 5 intervening terms. This query matches no documents.</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'database NEAR/5 sqlite';

<i>-- Search for a document that contains the phrase "ACID compliant" and the term</i>
<i>-- "database" with not more than 2 terms separating the two. This matches the</i>
<i>-- document stored in table docs.</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'database NEAR/2 "ACID compliant"';

<i>-- Search for a document that contains the phrase "ACID compliant" and the term</i>
<i>-- "sqlite" with not more than 2 terms separating the two. This also matches</i>
<i>-- the only document stored in table docs.</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH '"ACID compliant" NEAR/2 sqlite';
</pre></table></div>

<ul>
  <li style="list-style: none"><p>
    More than one NEAR operator may appear in a single query. In this case each
    pair of terms or phrases separated by a NEAR operator must appear within the
    specified proximity of each other in the document. Using the same table and
    data as in the block of examples above:
</ul>

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">
<i>-- The following query selects documents that contains an instance of the term </i>
<i>-- "sqlite" separated by two or fewer terms from an instance of the term "acid",</i>
<i>-- which is in turn separated by two or fewer terms from an instance of the term</i>
<i>-- "relational".</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'sqlite NEAR/2 acid NEAR/2 relational';

<i>-- This query matches no documents. There is an instance of the term "sqlite" with</i>
<i>-- sufficient proximity to an instance of "acid" but it is not sufficiently close</i>
<i>-- to an instance of the term "relational".</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'acid NEAR/2 sqlite NEAR/2 relational';
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  Phrase and NEAR queries may not span multiple columns within a row.

<p>
  The three basic query types described above may be used to query the full-text
  index for the set of documents that match the specified criteria. Using the
  FTS query expression language it is possible to perform various set 
  operations on the results of basic queries. There are currently three 
  supported operations:

<ul>
  <li> The AND operator determines the <b>intersection</b> of two sets of documents.

  <li> The OR operator calculates the <b>union</b> of two sets of documents.

  <li> The NOT operator (or, if using the standard syntax, a unary "-" operator)
       may be used to compute the <b>relative complement</b> of one set of
       documents with respect to another.
</ul>

<p>
  The FTS modules may be compiled to use one of two slightly different versions
  of the full-text query syntax, the "standard" query syntax and the "enhanced" 
  query syntax. The basic term, term-prefix, phrase and NEAR queries described 
  above are the same in both versions of the syntax. The way in which set 
  operations are specified is slightly different. The following two sub-sections 
  describe the part of the two query syntaxes that pertains to set operations. 
  Refer to the description of how to <a href="fts3.html#section_2">compile fts</a> for compilation notes.

<a name="section_3_1"></a>
<h2 id="section_3_1">3.1. 
  Set Operations Using The Enhanced Query Syntax</h2>

<p>
  The enhanced query syntax supports the AND, OR and NOT binary set operators.
  Each of the two operands to an operator may be a basic FTS query, or the
  result of another AND, OR or NOT set operation. Operators must be entered
  using capital letters. Otherwise, they are interpreted as basic term queries
  instead of set operators.

<p>
  The AND operator may be implicitly specified. If two basic queries appear 
  with no operator separating them in an FTS query string, the results are
  the same as if the two basic queries were separated by an AND operator.
  For example, the query expression "implicit operator" is a more succinct
  version of "implicit AND operator".

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Virtual table declaration</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE docs USING fts3();

<i>-- Virtual table data</i>
INSERT INTO docs(docid, content) VALUES(1, 'a database is a software system');
INSERT INTO docs(docid, content) VALUES(2, 'sqlite is a software system');
INSERT INTO docs(docid, content) VALUES(3, 'sqlite is a database');

<i>-- Return the set of documents that contain the term "sqlite", and the</i>
<i>-- term "database". This query will return the document with docid 3 only.</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'sqlite AND database';

<i>-- Again, return the set of documents that contain both "sqlite" and</i>
<i>-- "database". This time, use an implicit AND operator. Again, document</i>
<i>-- 3 is the only document matched by this query. </i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'database sqlite';

<i>-- Query for the set of documents that contains either "sqlite" or "database".</i>
<i>-- All three documents in the database are matched by this query.</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'sqlite OR database';

<i>-- Query for all documents that contain the term "database", but do not contain</i>
<i>-- the term "sqlite". Document 1 is the only document that matches this criteria.</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'database NOT sqlite';

<i>-- The following query matches no documents. Because "and" is in lowercase letters,</i>
<i>-- it is interpreted as a basic term query instead of an operator. Operators must</i>
<i>-- be specified using capital letters. In practice, this query will match any documents</i>
<i>-- that contain each of the three terms "database", "and" and "sqlite" at least once.</i>
<i>-- No documents in the example data above match this criteria.</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'database and sqlite';
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The examples above all use basic full-text term queries as both operands of 
  the set operations demonstrated. Phrase and NEAR queries may also be used,
  as may the results of other set operations. When more than one set operation
  is present in an FTS query, the precedence of operators is as follows:

<table style="margin:1em auto; width:80%; border-spacing:0">
  <tr style="text-align:left"><th>Operator<th>Enhanced Query Syntax Precedence
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>NOT <td> Highest precedence (tightest grouping).
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>AND <td>
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>OR  <td> Lowest precedence (loosest grouping).
</table>

<p>
  When using the enhanced query syntax, parenthesis may be used to override
  the default precedence of the various operators. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Return the docid values associated with all documents that contain the</i>
<i>-- two terms "sqlite" and "database", and/or contain the term "library".</i>
SELECT docid FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'sqlite AND database OR library';

<i>-- This query is equivalent to the above.</i>
SELECT docid FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'sqlite AND database'
  UNION
SELECT docid FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'library';

<i>-- Query for the set of documents that contains the term "linux", and at least</i>
<i>-- one of the phrases "sqlite database" and "sqlite library".</i>
SELECT docid FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH '("sqlite database" OR "sqlite library") AND linux';

<i>-- This query is equivalent to the above.</i>
SELECT docid FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'linux'
  INTERSECT
SELECT docid FROM (
  SELECT docid FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH '"sqlite library"'
    UNION
  SELECT docid FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH '"sqlite database"'
);
</pre></table></div>


<h2 id="section_3_2">3.2. Set Operations Using The Standard Query Syntax</h2>

<p>
  FTS query set operations using the standard query syntax are similar, but
  not identical, to set operations with the enhanced query syntax. There
  are four differences, as follows:

<ol>
  <li value="1"><p> Only the implicit version of the AND operator is supported.
    Specifying the string "AND" as part of a standard query syntax query is
    interpreted as a term query for the set of documents containing the term 
    "and".
</ol>

<ol>
  <li value="2"><p> Parenthesis are not supported.
</ol>

<ol>
  <li value="3"><p> The NOT operator is not supported. Instead of the NOT 
    operator, the standard query syntax supports a unary "-" operator that
    may be applied to basic term and term-prefix queries (but not to phrase
    or NEAR queries). A term or term-prefix that has a unary "-" operator
    attached to it may not appear as an operand to an OR operator. An FTS
    query may not consist entirely of terms or term-prefix queries with unary
    "-" operators attached to them.
</ol>

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Search for the set of documents that contain the term "sqlite" but do</i>
<i>-- not contain the term "database".</i>
SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs MATCH 'sqlite -database';
</pre></table></div>

<ol>
  <li value="4"><p> The relative precedence of the set operations is different. 
   In particular, using the standard query syntax the "OR" operator has a
   higher precedence than "AND". The precedence of operators when using the
   standard query syntax is: 
</ol>

<table style="margin:1em auto; width:80%; border-spacing:0">

<h1 id="section_4">4. Auxiliary Functions - Snippet, Offsets and Matchinfo</h1>

<p>
  The FTS3 and FTS4 modules provide three special SQL scalar functions that may be useful
  to the developers of full-text query systems: "snippet", "offsets" and
  "matchinfo". The purpose of the "snippet" and "offsets" functions is to allow
  the user to identify the location of queried terms in the returned documents.
  The "matchinfo" function provides the user with metrics that may be useful
  for filtering or sorting query results according to relevance.

<p>
  The first argument to all three special SQL scalar functions
  must be the <a href="fts3.html#hiddencol">FTS hidden column</a> of the FTS table that the function is
  applied to.  The <a href="fts3.html#hiddencol">FTS hidden column</a> is an automatically-generated column found on
  all FTS tables that has the same name as the FTS table itself.
  For example, given an FTS table named "mail":

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">SELECT offsets(mail) FROM mail WHERE mail MATCH &lt;full-text query expression&gt;;
SELECT snippet(mail) FROM mail WHERE mail MATCH &lt;full-text query expression&gt;;
SELECT matchinfo(mail) FROM mail WHERE mail MATCH &lt;full-text query expression&gt;;
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The three auxiliary functions are only useful within a SELECT statement that
  uses the FTS table's full-text index. If used within a SELECT that uses
  the "query by rowid" or "linear scan" strategies, then the snippet and
  offsets both return an empty string, and the matchinfo function returns
  a blob value zero bytes in size.

<p id="matchable">
  All three auxiliary functions extract a set of "matchable phrases" from
  the FTS query expression to work with. The set of matchable phrases for
  a given query consists of all phrases (including unquoted tokens and
  token prefixes) in the expression except those that are prefixed with
  a unary "-" operator (standard syntax) or are part of a sub-expression 
  that is used as the right-hand operand of a NOT operator.

<p>
  With the following provisos, each series of tokens in the FTS table that
  matches one of the matchable phrases in the query expression is known as a
  "phrase match":

<ol>
  <li> If a matchable phrase is part of a series of phrases connected by
       NEAR operators in the FTS query expression, then each phrase match
       must be sufficiently close to other phrase matches of the relevant
       types to satisfy the NEAR condition.

  <li> If the matchable phrase in the FTS query is restricted to matching
       data in a specified FTS table column, then only phrase matches that 
       occur within that column are considered.
</ol>
 
<a name="offsets"></a>

<h2 id="section_4_1">4.1. The Offsets Function</h2>

<p>
  For a SELECT query that uses the full-text index, the offsets() function 
  returns a text value containing a series of space-separated integers. For
  each term in each <a href="#matchable">phrase match</a> of the current row, 
  there are four integers in the returned list. Each set of four integers is 
  interpreted as follows:

<table style="margin:1em auto; width:80%; border-spacing:0">
  <tr style="text-align:left"><th>Integer <th>Interpretation
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>0 
      <td>The column number that the term instance occurs in (0 for the
          leftmost column of the FTS table, 1 for the next leftmost, etc.).
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>1
      <td>The term number of the matching term within the full-text query
          expression. Terms within a query expression are numbered starting
          from 0 in the order that they occur.
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>2
      <td>The byte offset of the matching term within the column.
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>3
      <td>The size of the matching term in bytes.
</table>

<p>
  The following block contains examples that use the offsets function.

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE mail USING fts3(subject, body);
INSERT INTO mail VALUES('hello world', 'This message is a hello world message.');
INSERT INTO mail VALUES('urgent: serious', 'This mail is seen as a more serious mail');

<i>-- The following query returns a single row (as it matches only the first</i>
<i>-- entry in table "mail". The text returned by the offsets function is</i>
<i>-- "0 0 6 5 1 0 24 5".</i>
<i>--</i>
<i>-- The first set of four integers in the result indicate that column 0</i>
<i>-- contains an instance of term 0 ("world") at byte offset 6. The term instance</i>
<i>-- is 5 bytes in size. The second set of four integers shows that column 1</i>
<i>-- of the matched row contains an instance of term 0 ("world") at byte offset</i>
<i>-- 24. Again, the term instance is 5 bytes in size.</i>
SELECT offsets(mail) FROM mail WHERE mail MATCH 'world';

<i>-- The following query returns also matches only the first row in table "mail".</i>
<i>-- In this case the returned text is "1 0 5 7 1 0 30 7".</i>
SELECT offsets(mail) FROM mail WHERE mail MATCH 'message';

<i>-- The following query matches the second row in table "mail". It returns the</i>
<i>-- text "1 0 28 7 1 1 36 4". Only those occurrences of terms "serious" and "mail"</i>
<i>-- that are part of an instance of the phrase "serious mail" are identified; the</i>
<i>-- other occurrences of "serious" and "mail" are ignored.</i>
SELECT offsets(mail) FROM mail WHERE mail MATCH '"serious mail"';
</pre></table></div>

<a name="snippet"></a>

<h2 id="section_4_2">4.2. The Snippet Function</h2>

<p>
  The snippet function is used to create formatted fragments of document text
  for display as part of a full-text query results report. The snippet function 
  may be passed between one and six arguments, as follows:

<table style="margin:1em auto; width:80%; border-spacing:0">
  <tr style="text-align:left"><th>Argument <th>Default Value <th>Description
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>0 <td>N/A
      <td> The first argument to the snippet function must always be the <a href="fts3.html#hiddencol">FTS hidden column</a>
           of the FTS table being queried and from which the snippet is to be taken.  The
           <a href="fts3.html#hiddencol">FTS hidden column</a> is an automatically generated column with the same name as the
           FTS table itself.
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>1 <td>"&lt;b&gt;"
      <td> The "start match" text.
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>2 <td>"&lt;/b&gt;"
      <td> The "end match" text.
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>3 <td>"&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;"
      <td> The "ellipses" text.
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>4 <td>-1
      <td> The FTS table column number to extract the returned fragments of
           text from. Columns are numbered from left to right starting with
           zero. A negative value indicates that the text may be extracted
           from any column.
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>5 <td>-15
      <td> The absolute value of this integer argument is used as the 
           (approximate) number of tokens to include in the returned text 
           value. The maximum allowable absolute value is 64. The value of
           this argument is referred to as <i>N</i> in the discussion below.
</table>

<p>
  The snippet function first attempts to find a fragment of text consisting
  of <i>|N|</i> tokens within the current row that contains at least one phrase 
  match for each matchable phrase matched somewhere in the current row, 
  where <i>|N|</i> is the absolute value of the sixth argument passed to the
  snippet function. If the text stored in a single column contains less than
  <i>|N|</i> tokens, then the entire column value is considered. Text fragments 
  may not span multiple columns.

<p>
  If such a text fragment can be found, it is returned with the following
  modifications:

<ul>
  <li> If the text fragment does not begin at the start of a column value,
       the "ellipses" text is prepended to it.
  <li> If the text fragment does not finish at the end of a column value,
       the "ellipses" text is appended to it.
  <li> For each token in the text fragment that is part of a phrase match,
       the "start match" text is inserted into the fragment before the token,
       and the "end match" text is inserted immediately after it.
</ul>

<p>
  If more than one such fragment can be found, then fragments that contain
  a larger number of "extra" phrase matches are favored. The start of
  the selected text fragment may be moved a few tokens forward or backward
  to attempt to concentrate the phrase matches toward the center of the
  fragment.

<p>
  Assuming <i>N</i> is a positive value, if no fragments can be found that
  contain a phrase match corresponding to each matchable phrase, the snippet
  function attempts to find two fragments of approximately <i>N</i>/2 tokens
  that between them contain at least one phrase match for each matchable phrase
  matched by the current row. If this fails, attempts are made to find three
  fragments of <i>N</i>/3 tokens each and finally four <i>N</i>/4 token
  fragments. If a set of four fragments cannot be found that encompasses the
  required phrase matches, the four fragments of <i>N</i>/4 tokens that provide
  the best coverage are selected.

<p>
  If <i>N</i> is a negative value, and no single fragment can be found 
  containing the required phrase matches, the snippet function searches
  for two fragments of <i>|N|</i> tokens each, then three, then four. In
  other words, if the specified value of <i>N</i> is negative, the sizes
  of the fragments is not decreased if more than one fragment is required
  to provide the desired phrase match coverage.

<p>
  After the <i>M</i> fragments have been located, where <i>M</i> is between
  two and four as described in the paragraphs above, they are joined together
  in sorted order with the "ellipses" text separating them. The three 
  modifications enumerated earlier are performed on the text before it is 
  returned.

<a name="matchinfo"></a>
<h2 id="matchinfo">4.3. The Matchinfo Function</h2>

<p>
  The matchinfo function returns a blob value. If it is used within a query
  that does not use the full-text index (a "query by rowid" or "linear scan"),
  then the blob is zero bytes in size. Otherwise, the blob consists of zero
  or more 32-bit unsigned integers in machine byte-order. The exact number
  of integers in the returned array depends on both the query and the value
  of the second argument (if any) passed to the matchinfo function.

<p>
  The matchinfo function is called with either one or two arguments. As for
  all auxiliary functions, the first argument must be the special 
  <a href="fts3.html#hiddencol">FTS hidden column</a>. The second argument, if it is specified, must be a text value
  comprised only of the characters 'p', 'c', 'n', 'a', 'l', 's', 'x', 'y' and 'b'.
  If no second argument is explicitly supplied, it defaults to "pcx". The
  second argument is referred to as the "format string" below.

<p>
  Characters in the matchinfo format string are processed from left to right. 
  Each character in the format string causes one or more 32-bit unsigned
  integer values to be added to the returned array. The "values" column in
  the following table contains the number of integer values appended to the
  output buffer for each supported format string character. In the formula
  given, <i>cols</i> is the number of columns in the FTS table, and 
  <i>phrases</i> is the number of <a href="#matchable">matchable phrases</a> in 
  the query. 

<table style="margin:1em auto; width:80%; border-spacing:0">
  <tr style="text-align:left"><th>Character<th>Values<th>Description
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>p <td>1 <td>The number of matchable phrases in the query.
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>c <td>1 <td>The number of user defined columns in the FTS
    table (i.e. not including the docid or the <a href="fts3.html#hiddencol">FTS hidden column</a>).
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>x <td style="white-space:nowrap">3 * <i>cols</i> * <i>phrases</i> 
    <td><a name="matchinfo-x"></a>

      For each distinct combination of a phrase and table column, the
      following three values:
      <ul>
        <li> In the current row, the number of times the phrase appears in 
             the column.
        <li> The total number of times the phrase appears in the column in
             all rows in the FTS table.
        <li> The total number of rows in the FTS table for which the 
             column contains at least one instance of the phrase.
      </ul>
      The first set of three values corresponds to the left-most column
      of the table (column 0) and the left-most matchable phrase in the
      query (phrase 0). If the table has more than one column, the second
      set of three values in the output array correspond to phrase 0 and
      column 1. Followed by phrase 0, column 2 and so on for all columns of
      the table. And so on for phrase 1, column 0, then phrase 1, column 1
      etc. In other words, the data for occurrences of phrase <i>p</i> in
      column <i>c</i> may be found using the following formula:
<pre>
          hits_this_row  = array&#91;3 * (c + p*cols) + 0&#93;
          hits_all_rows  = array&#91;3 * (c + p*cols) + 1&#93;
          docs_with_hits = array&#91;3 * (c + p*cols) + 2&#93;
</pre>
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>y<td style="white-space:nowrap"><i>cols</i> * <i>phrases</i> 
    <td><a name="matchinfo-y"></a>

      For each distinct combination of a phrase and table column, the
      number of usable phrase matches that appear in the column. This is
      usually identical to the first value in each set of three returned by the
      <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo-x">matchinfo 'x' flag</a>. However, the number of hits reported by the
      'y' flag is zero for any phrase that is part of a sub-expression
      that does not match the current row. This makes a difference for
      expressions that contain AND operators that are descendants of OR
      operators. For example, consider the expression: 
<pre>
          a OR (b AND c)
</pre>
      and the document:
<pre>
          "a c d"
</pre>
      The <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo-x">matchinfo 'x' flag</a> would report a single hit for the phrases "a" and "c".
      However, the 'y' directive reports the number of hits for "c" as zero, as
      it is part of a sub-expression that does not match the document - (b AND c).
      For queries that do not contain AND operators descended from OR
      operators, the result values returned by 'y' are always the same as
      those returned by 'x'.

<p style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0">
      The first value in the array of integer values corresponds to the
      leftmost column of the table (column 0) and the first phrase in the query
      (phrase 0). The values corresponding to other column/phrase combinations
      may be located using the following formula:

<pre>
          hits_for_phrase_p_column_c  = array&#91;c + p*cols&#93;
</pre>
      For queries that use OR expressions, or those that use LIMIT or return
      many rows, the 'y' matchinfo option may be faster than 'x'.

<tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>b<td style="white-space:nowrap"><i>((cols+31)/32)</i> * <i>phrases</i> 
<td><a name="matchinfo-b"></a>


  The matchinfo 'b' flag provides similar information to the
  <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo-y">matchinfo 'y' flag</a>, but in a more
  compact form. Instead of the precise number of hits, 'b' provides a single
  boolean flag for each phrase/column combination. If the phrase is present in
  the column at least once (i.e. if the corresponding integer output of 'y' would
  be non-zero), the corresponding flag is set. Otherwise cleared.

<p style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0">
  If the table has 32 or fewer columns, a single unsigned integer is output for
  each phrase in the query. The least significant bit of the integer is set if the
  phrase appears at least once in column 0. The second least significant bit is
  set if the phrase appears once or more in column 1. And so on.

<p style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0">
  If the table has more than 32 columns, an extra integer is added to the output
  of each phrase for each extra 32 columns or part thereof. Integers
  corresponding to the same phrase are clumped together. For example, if a table
  with 45 columns is queried for two phrases, 4 integers are output. The first
  corresponds to phrase 0 and columns 0-31 of the table. The second integer
  contains data for phrase 0 and columns 32-44, and so on.

<p style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0">
  For example, if nCol is the number of columns in the table, to determine if
  phrase p is present in column c:

<pre>
    p_is_in_c = array&#91;p * ((nCol+31)/32)&#93; & (1 &lt;&lt; (c % 32))
</pre>

  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>n <td>1 <td>The number of rows in the FTS4 table. This value is

  For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create and populate an FTS4 table with two columns:</i>

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES('transaction default models default', 'Non transaction reads');
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES('the default transaction', 'these semantics present');
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES('single request', 'default data');

<i>-- In the following query, no format string is specified and so it defaults</i>
<i>-- to "pcx". It therefore returns a single row consisting of a single blob</i>
<i>-- value 80 bytes in size (20 32-bit integers - 1 for "p", 1 for "c" and</i>

</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The matchinfo function is much faster than either the snippet or offsets
  functions. This is because the implementation of both snippet and offsets
  is required to retrieve the documents being analyzed from disk, whereas
  all data required by matchinfo is available as part of the same portions
  of the full-text index that are required to implement the full-text query
  itself. This means that of the following two queries, the first may be
  an order of magnitude faster than the second:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">SELECT docid, matchinfo(tbl) FROM tbl WHERE tbl MATCH &lt;query expression&gt;;
SELECT docid, offsets(tbl) FROM tbl WHERE tbl MATCH &lt;query expression&gt;;
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The matchinfo function provides all the information required to calculate
  probabilistic "bag-of-words" relevancy scores such as 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25">Okapi BM25/BM25F</a> that may
  be used to order results in a full-text search application. Appendix A of this 
  document, "<a href="fts3.html#appendix_a">search application tips</a>", contains an example of using the
  matchinfo() function efficiently.

<a name="fts4aux"></a>
<h1 id="fts4aux">5. Fts4aux - Direct Access to the Full-Text Index</h1>

<p>
  As of version 3.7.6, SQLite includes a new virtual table module called 
  "fts4aux", which can be used to inspect the full-text index of an existing
  FTS table directly. Despite its name, fts4aux works just as well with FTS3
  tables as it does with FTS4 tables. Fts4aux tables are read-only. The only
  way to modify the contents of an fts4aux table is by modifying the
  contents of the associated FTS table. The fts4aux module is automatically
  included in all <a href="fts3.html#section_2">builds that include FTS</a>.

<p>
  An fts4aux virtual table is constructed with one or two arguments.  When
  used with a single argument, that argument is the unqualified name of the
  FTS table that it will be used to access.  To access a table in a different
  database (for example, to create a TEMP fts4aux table that will access an
  FTS3 table in the MAIN database) use the two-argument form and give the
  name of the target database (ex: "main") in the first argument and the name
  of the FTS3/4 table as the second argument.  (The two-argument form of 
  fts4aux was added for SQLite version 3.7.17 and will throw an error in
  prior releases.)
  For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create an FTS4 table</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft USING fts4(x, y);

<i>-- Create an fts4aux table to access the full-text index for table "ft"</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE ft_terms USING fts4aux(ft);

<i>-- Create a TEMP fts4aux table accessing the "ft" table in "main"</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE temp.ft_terms_2 USING fts4aux(main,ft);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  For each term present in the FTS table, there are between 2 and N+1 rows
  in the fts4aux table, where N is the number of user-defined columns in
  the associated FTS table. An fts4aux table always has the same four columns, 
  as follows, from left to right:

<table style="margin:1em auto; width:80%; border-spacing:0">
  <tr style="text-align:left"><th>Column Name<th>Column Contents
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>term<td> 
    Contains the text of the term for this row.
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>col<td> 
    This column may contain either the text value '*' (i.e. a single 
    character, U+002a) or an integer between 0 and N-1, where N is
    again the number of user-defined columns in the corresponding FTS table.

  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>documents<td>
    This column always contains an integer value greater than zero.
    <br><br>
    If the "col" column contains the value '*', then this column
    contains the number of rows of the FTS table that contain at least one
    instance of the term (in any column). If col contains an integer
    value, then this column contains the number of rows of the FTS table that
    contain at least one instance of the term in the column identified by
    the col value. As usual, the columns of the FTS table are numbered
    from left to right, starting with zero.

  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>occurrences<td>
    This column also always contains an integer value greater than zero.
    <br><br>
    If the "col" column contains the value '*', then this column
    contains the total number of instances of the term in all rows of the 
    FTS table (in any column). Otherwise, if col contains an integer
    value, then this column contains the total number of instances of the
    term that appear in the FTS table column identified by the col
    value.

  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>languageid <i>(hidden)</i><td>
    <a name="f4alid"></a>

    This column determines which <a href="fts3.html#*fts4languageid">languageid</a> is used to
    extract vocabulary from the FTS3/4 table.
    <br><br>
    The default value for languageid is 0.  If an alternative language
    is specified in WHERE clause constraints, then that alternative is
    used instead of 0.  There can only be a single languageid per query.
    In other words, the WHERE clause cannot contain a range constraint
    or IN operator on the languageid.
</table>

<p>
  For example, using the tables created above:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">INSERT INTO ft(x, y) VALUES('Apple banana', 'Cherry');
INSERT INTO ft(x, y) VALUES('Banana Date Date', 'cherry');
INSERT INTO ft(x, y) VALUES('Cherry Elderberry', 'Elderberry');

<i>-- The following query returns this data:</i>
<i>--</i>
<i>--     apple       |  *  |  1  |  1</i>
<i>--     apple       |  0  |  1  |  1</i>
<i>--     banana      |  *  |  2  |  2</i>
<i>--     banana      |  0  |  2  |  2</i>
<i>--     cherry      |  *  |  3  |  3</i>
<i>--     cherry      |  0  |  1  |  1</i>
<i>--     cherry      |  1  |  2  |  2</i>
<i>--     date        |  *  |  1  |  2</i>
<i>--     date        |  0  |  1  |  2</i>
<i>--     elderberry  |  *  |  1  |  2</i>
<i>--     elderberry  |  0  |  1  |  1</i>
<i>--     elderberry  |  1  |  1  |  1</i>
<i>--</i>
SELECT term, col, documents, occurrences FROM ft_terms;
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  In the example, the values in the "term" column are all lower case, 
  even though they were inserted into table "ft" in mixed case. This is because
  an fts4aux table contains the terms as extracted from the document text
  by the <a href="fts3.html#tokenizer">tokenizer</a>. In this case, since table "ft" uses the 
  <a href="fts3.html#tokenizer">simple tokenizer</a>, this means all terms have been folded to
  lower case. Also, there is (for example) no row with column "term"
  set to "apple" and column "col" set to 1. Since there are no instances
  of the term "apple" in column 1, no row is present in the fts4aux table.

<p>
  During a transaction, some of the data written to an FTS table may be 
  cached in memory and written to the database only when the transaction is 
  committed. However the implementation of the fts4aux module is only able 
  to read data from the database. In practice this means that if an fts4aux 
  table is queried from within a transaction in which the associated 
  FTS table has been modified, the results of the query are likely to reflect 
  only a (possibly empty) subset of the changes made.

<a name="fts4_options"></a>
<h1 id="fts4_options">6. FTS4 Options</h1>

<p>
  If the "CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE" statement specifies module FTS4 (not FTS3), 
  then special directives - FTS4 options - similar to the "tokenize=*" option
  may also appear in place of column names. An FTS4 option consists of the
  option name, followed by an "=" character, followed by the option value.
  The option value may optionally be enclosed in single or double quotes, with
  embedded quote characters escaped in the same way as for SQL literals. There
  may not be whitespace on either side of the "=" character. For example,
  to create an FTS4 table with the value of option "matchinfo" set to "fts3":

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create a reduced-footprint FTS4 table.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts4(author, document, matchinfo=fts3);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  FTS4 currently supports the following options:

<table style="margin:1em auto; width:80%; border-spacing:0">
  <tr style="text-align:left"><th>Option<th>Interpretation
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>compress<td>
    The compress option is used to specify the compress function. It is an error to
    specify a compress function without also specifying an uncompress
    function. <a href="fts3.html#section_6_1">See below</a> for details.

  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>content<td>
    The content allows the text being indexed to be
    stored in a separate table distinct from the FTS4 table,
    or even outside of SQLite.

  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>languageid<td>
    The languageid option causes the FTS4 table to have an additional hidden
    integer column that identifies the language of the text contained in
    each row.  The use of the languageid option allows the same FTS4 table
    to hold text in multiple languages or scripts, each with different tokenizer
    rules, and to query each language independently of the others.
    
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>matchinfo<td> 
    When set to the value "fts3", the matchinfo option reduces the amount of
    information stored by FTS4 with the consequence that the "l" option of
    <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo">matchinfo()</a> is no longer available.

  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>notindexed<td> 
    This option is used to specify the name of a column for which data is
    not indexed. Values stored in columns that are not indexed are not
    matched by MATCH queries. Nor are they recognized by auxiliary functions.
    A single CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement may have any number of notindexed 
    options.

  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>order<td>
    <a name="fts4order"></a>

    The "order" option may be set to either "DESC" or "ASC" (in upper or
    lower case). If it is set to "DESC", then FTS4 stores its data in such
    a way as to optimize returning results in descending order by docid.
    If it is set to "ASC" (the default), then the data structures are 
    optimized for returning results in ascending order by docid.  In other
    words, if many of the queries run against the FTS4 table use "ORDER BY
    docid DESC", then it may improve performance to add the "order=desc" 
    option to the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement.

  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>prefix<td>
    This option may be set to a comma-separated list of positive non-zero 
    integers. For each integer N in the list, a separate index is created
    in the database file to optimize <a href="fts3.html#termprefix">prefix queries</a> where
    the query term is N bytes in length, not including the '*' character,
    when encoded using UTF-8. <a href="fts3.html#section_6_6">See below</a> for details.

  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>uncompress<td>
    This option is used to specify the uncompress function. It is an error to
    specify an uncompress function without also specifying a compress
    function. <a href="fts3.html#section_6_1">See below</a> for details.
</table>

<p>
  When using FTS4, specifying a column name that contains an "=" character
  and is not either a "tokenize=*" specification or a recognized FTS4 option
  is an error. With FTS3, the first token in the unrecognized directive is 
  interpreted as a column name. Similarly, specifying multiple "tokenize=*"
  directives in a single table declaration is an error when using FTS4, whereas
  the second and subsequent "tokenize=*" directives are interpreted as column
  names by FTS3. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- An error. FTS4 does not recognize the directive "xyz=abc".</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts4(author, document, xyz=abc);

<i>-- Create an FTS3 table with three columns - "author", "document"</i>
<i>-- and "xyz".</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts3(author, document, xyz=abc);

<i>-- An error. FTS4 does not allow multiple tokenize=* directives</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts4(tokenize=porter, tokenize=simple);

<i>-- Create an FTS3 table with a single column named "tokenize". The</i>
<i>-- table uses the "porter" tokenizer.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts3(tokenize=porter, tokenize=simple);

<i>-- An error. Cannot create a table with two columns named "tokenize".</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts3(tokenize=porter, tokenize=simple, tokenize=icu);
</pre></table></div>

<a name="*fts4compression"></a>

<a name="section_6_1"></a>
<h2 id="section_6_1">6.1. The compress= and uncompress= options</h2>

<p>
  The compress and uncompress options allow FTS4 content to be stored in
  the database in a compressed form. Both options should be set to the name
  of an SQL scalar function registered using <a href="c3ref/create_function.html">sqlite3_create_function()</a>
  that accepts a single argument. 

<p>
  The compress function should return a compressed version of the value 
  passed to it as an argument. Each time data is written to the FTS4 table, 
  each column value is passed to the compress function and the result value 
  stored in the database. The compress function may return any type of SQLite 
  value (blob, text, real, integer or null).

<p>
  The uncompress function should uncompress data previously compressed by
  the compress function. In other words, for all SQLite values X, it should
  be true that uncompress(compress(X)) equals X. When data that has been
  compressed by the compress function is read from the database by FTS4, it
  is passed to the uncompress function before it is used.

<p>
  If the specified compress or uncompress functions do not exist, the table
  may still be created. An error is not returned until the FTS4 table is
  read (if the uncompress function does not exist) or written (if it is the 
  compress function that does not exist).

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create an FTS4 table that stores data in compressed form. This</i>
<i>-- assumes that the scalar functions zip() and unzip() have been (or</i>
<i>-- will be) added to the database handle.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE papers USING fts4(author, document, compress=zip, uncompress=unzip);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  When implementing the compress and uncompress functions it is important to
  pay attention to data types. Specifically, when a user reads a value from
  a compressed FTS table, the value returned by FTS is exactly the same
  as the value returned by the uncompress function, including the data type.
  If that data type is not the same as the data type of the original value as
  passed to the compress function (for example if the uncompress function is
  returning BLOB when compress was originally passed TEXT), then the users
  query may not function as expected.

<a name="*fts4content"></a>

<a name="section_6_2"></a>
<h2 id="section_6_2">6.2. The content= option </h2>

<p>
  The content option allows FTS4 to forego storing the text being indexed.
  The content option can be used in two ways:

<ul>
<li><p> The indexed documents are not stored within the SQLite database 
        at all (a "contentless" FTS4 table), or

<li><p> The indexed documents are stored in a database table created and
        managed by the user (an "external content" FTS4 table).
</ul>

<p>
  Because the indexed documents themselves are usually much larger than 
  the full-text index, the content option can be used to achieve 
  significant space savings.

<a name="section_6_2_1"></a>
<h3 id="section_6_2_1">6.2.1.  Contentless FTS4 Tables </h3>

<p>
  In order to create an FTS4 table that does not store a copy of the indexed
  documents at all, the content option should be set to an empty string.
  For example, the following SQL creates such an FTS4 table with three
  columns - "a", "b", and "c":

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1 USING fts4(content="", a, b, c);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  Data can be inserted into such an FTS4 table using an INSERT statements.
  However, unlike ordinary FTS4 tables, the user must supply an explicit
  integer docid value. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- This statement is Ok:</i>
INSERT INTO t1(docid, a, b, c) VALUES(1, 'a b c', 'd e f', 'g h i');

<i>-- This statement causes an error, as no docid value has been provided:</i>
INSERT INTO t1(a, b, c) VALUES('j k l', 'm n o', 'p q r');
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  It is not possible to UPDATE or DELETE a row stored in a contentless FTS4
  table. Attempting to do so is an error.

<p>
  Contentless FTS4 tables also support SELECT statements. However, it is
  an error to attempt to retrieve the value of any table column other than
  the docid column. The auxiliary function matchinfo() may be used, but
  snippet() and offsets() may not. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- The following statements are Ok:</i>
SELECT docid FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'xxx';
SELECT docid FROM t1 WHERE a MATCH 'xxx';
SELECT matchinfo(t1) FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'xxx';

<i>-- The following statements all cause errors, as the value of columns</i>
<i>-- other than docid are required to evaluate them.</i>
SELECT * FROM t1;
SELECT a, b FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'xxx';
SELECT docid FROM t1 WHERE a LIKE 'xxx%';
SELECT snippet(t1) FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'xxx';
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  Errors related to attempting to retrieve column values other than docid
  are runtime errors that occur within sqlite3_step(). In some cases, for
  example if the MATCH expression in a SELECT query matches zero rows, there
  may be no error at all even if a statement does refer to column values 
  other than docid.

<a name="section_6_2_2"></a>
<h3 id="section_6_2_2">6.2.2.  External Content FTS4 Tables </h3>

<p>
  An "external content" FTS4 table is similar to a contentless table, except
  that if evaluation of a query requires the value of a column other than 
  docid, FTS4 attempts to retrieve that value from a table (or view, or 
  virtual table) nominated by the user (hereafter referred to as the "content
  table"). The FTS4 module never writes to the content table, and writing
  to the content table does not affect the full-text index. It is the
  responsibility of the user to ensure that the content table and the 
  full-text index are consistent.

<p>
  An external content FTS4 table is created by setting the content option
  to the name of a table (or view, or virtual table) that may be queried by
  FTS4 to retrieve column values when required. If the nominated table does
  not exist, then an external content table behaves in the same way as
  a contentless table. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE TABLE t2(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, a, b, c);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t3 USING fts4(content="t2", a, c);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  Assuming the nominated table does exist, then its columns must be the same 
  as or a superset of those defined for the FTS table.  The external table
  must also be in the same database file as the FTS table.  In other words,
  The external table cannot be in a different database file connected using
  <a href="lang_attach.html">ATTACH</a> nor may one of the FTS table and the external content be in the
  TEMP database when the other is in a persistent database file such as MAIN.

<p>
  When a users query on the FTS table requires a column value other than
  docid, FTS attempts to read the requested value from the corresponding column of
  the row in the content table with a rowid value equal to the current FTS
  docid. Or, if such a row cannot be found in the content table, a NULL
  value is used instead. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE TABLE t2(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, a, b, c);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t3 USING fts4(content="t2", b, c);

INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(2, 'a b', 'c d', 'e f');
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(3, 'g h', 'i j', 'k l');
INSERT INTO t3(docid, b, c) SELECT id, b, c FROM t2;
<i>-- The following query returns a single row with two columns containing
-- the text values "i j" and "k l".
--
-- The query uses the full-text index to discover that the MATCH 
-- term matches the row with docid=3. It then retrieves the values
-- of columns b and c from the row with rowid=3 in the content table
-- to return.
--</i>
SELECT * FROM t3 WHERE t3 MATCH 'k';

<i>-- Following the UPDATE, the query still returns a single row, this
-- time containing the text values "xxx" and "yyy". This is because the
-- full-text index still indicates that the row with docid=3 matches
-- the FTS4 query 'k', even though the documents stored in the content
-- table have been modified.
--</i>
UPDATE t2 SET b = 'xxx', c = 'yyy' WHERE rowid = 3;
SELECT * FROM t3 WHERE t3 MATCH 'k';

<i>-- Following the DELETE below, the query returns one row containing two
-- NULL values. NULL values are returned because FTS is unable to find
-- a row with rowid=3 within the content table.
--</i>
DELETE FROM t2;
SELECT * FROM t3 WHERE t3 MATCH 'k';
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  When a row is deleted from an external content FTS4 table, FTS4 needs to
  retrieve the column values of the row being deleted from the content table.
  This is so that FTS4 can update the full-text index entries for each token
  that occurs within the deleted row to indicate that row has been 
  deleted. If the content table row cannot be found, or if it contains values
  inconsistent with the contents of the FTS index, the results can be difficult
  to predict. The FTS index may be left containing entries corresponding to the
  deleted row, which can lead to seemingly nonsensical results being returned
  by subsequent SELECT queries. The same applies when a row is updated, as
  internally an UPDATE is the same as a DELETE followed by an INSERT.

<p>
  This means that in order to keep an FTS in sync with an external content
  table, any UPDATE or DELETE operations must be applied first to the FTS
  table, and then to the external content table. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE TABLE t1_real(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, a, b, c, d);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1_fts USING fts4(content="t1_real", b, c);

<i>-- This works. When the row is removed from the FTS table, FTS retrieves 
-- the row with rowid=123 and tokenizes it in order to determine the entries 
-- that must be removed from the full-text index.
--</i> 
DELETE FROM t1_fts WHERE rowid = 123;
DELETE FROM t1_real WHERE rowid = 123;

--<i> This <b>does not work</b>. By the time the FTS table is updated, the row
-- has already been deleted from the underlying content table. As a result
-- FTS is unable to determine the entries to remove from the FTS index and
-- so the index and content table are left out of sync.
--</i>
DELETE FROM t1_real WHERE rowid = 123;
DELETE FROM t1_fts WHERE rowid = 123;
</pre></table></div>

<p>  
  Instead of writing separately to the full-text index and the content table,
  some users may wish to use database triggers to keep the full-text index
  up to date with respect to the set of documents stored in the content table.
  For example, using the tables from earlier examples:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE TRIGGER t2_bu BEFORE UPDATE ON t2 BEGIN
  DELETE FROM t3 WHERE docid=old.rowid;
END;
CREATE TRIGGER t2_bd BEFORE DELETE ON t2 BEGIN
  DELETE FROM t3 WHERE docid=old.rowid;
END;

CREATE TRIGGER t2_au AFTER UPDATE ON t2 BEGIN
  INSERT INTO t3(docid, b, c) VALUES(new.rowid, new.b, new.c);
END;
CREATE TRIGGER t2_ai AFTER INSERT ON t2 BEGIN
  INSERT INTO t3(docid, b, c) VALUES(new.rowid, new.b, new.c);
END;
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The DELETE trigger must be fired before the actual delete takes place
  on the content table. This is so that FTS4 can still retrieve the original
  values in order to update the full-text index. And the INSERT trigger must
  be fired after the new row is inserted, so as to handle the case where the
  rowid is assigned automatically within the system. The UPDATE trigger must
  be split into two parts, one fired before and one after the update of the
  content table, for the same reasons.

<p>
  The <a href="fts3.html#*fts4rebuidcmd">FTS4 "rebuild" command</a>
  deletes the entire full-text index and rebuilds it based on the current
  set of documents in the content table. Assuming again that "t3" is the
  name of the external content FTS4 table, the rebuild command looks like this:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">INSERT INTO t3(t3) VALUES('rebuild');
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  This command may also be used with ordinary FTS4 tables, for example if
  the implementation of the tokenizer changes.  It is an
  error to attempt to rebuild the full-text index maintained by a contentless
  FTS4 table, since no content will be available to do the rebuilding.


<a name="*fts4languageid"></a>

<a name="section_6_3"></a>
<h2 id="section_6_3">6.3. The languageid= option</h2>

<p>
  When the languageid option is present, it specifies the name of
  another <a href="vtab.html#hiddencol">hidden column</a> that is added to the FTS4
  table and which is used to specify the language stored in each row
  of the FTS4 table.  The name of the languageid hidden column must
  be distinct from all other column names in the FTS4 table.  Example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1 USING fts4(x, y, languageid="lid")
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The default value of a languageid column is 0. Any value inserted
  into a languageid column is converted to a 32-bit (not 64) signed
  integer.

<p>
  By default, FTS queries (those that use the MATCH operator)
  consider only those rows with the languageid column set to 0. To
  query for rows with other languageid values, a constraint of the
  form "<language-id> = <integer>" must be added to the queries
  WHERE clause. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'abc' AND lid=5;
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  It is not possible for a single FTS query to return rows with
  different languageid values. The results of adding WHERE clauses
  that use other operators (e.g.  lid!=5, or lid&lt;=5) are undefined.

<p>
  If the content option is used along with the languageid option,
  then the named languageid column must exist in the content= table
  (subject to the usual rules - if a query never needs to read the
  content table then this restriction does not apply).

<p>
  When the languageid option is used, SQLite invokes the xLanguageid()
  on the sqlite3_tokenizer_module object immediately after the object
  is created in order to pass in the language id that the
  tokenizer should use.  The xLanguageid() method will never be called
  more than once for any single tokenizer object.  The fact that different
  languages might be tokenized differently is one reason why no single
  FTS query can return rows with different languageid values.
  


<a name="fts4matchinfo"></a>

<a name="section_6_4"></a>
<h2 id="section_6_4">6.4. The matchinfo= option</h2>

<p>
  The matchinfo option may only be set to the value "fts3". 
  Attempting to set matchinfo to anything other than "fts3" is an error.
  If this option is specified, then some of the extra information stored by
  FTS4 is omitted. This reduces the amount of disk space consumed by
  an FTS4 table until it is almost the same as the amount that would
  be used by the equivalent FTS3 table, but also means that the data
  accessed by passing the 'l' flag to the <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo">matchinfo()</a> function is
  not available. 

<a name="fts4notindexed"></a>

<a name="section_6_5"></a>
<h2 id="section_6_5">6.5. The notindexed= option</h2>

<p>
  Normally, the FTS module maintains an inverted index of all terms in
  all columns of the table. This option is used to specify the name of
  a column for which entries should not be added to the index. Multiple
  "notindexed" options may be used to specify that multiple columns should
  be omitted from the index. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create an FTS4 table for which only the contents of columns c2 and c4</i>
<i>-- are tokenized and added to the inverted index.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1 USING fts4(c1, c2, c3, c4, notindexed=c1, notindexed=c3);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  Values stored in unindexed columns are not eligible to match MATCH 
  operators. The do not influence the results of the offsets() or matchinfo()
  auxiliary functions. Nor will the snippet() function ever return a
  snippet based on a value stored in an unindexed column.

<a name="fts4prefix"></a>

<a name="section_6_6"></a>
<h2 id="section_6_6">6.6. The prefix= option</h2>

<p>
  The FTS4 prefix option causes FTS to index term prefixes of specified lengths
  in the same way that it always indexes complete terms.  The prefix option
  must be set to a comma separated list of positive non-zero integers. 
  For each value N in the list, prefixes of length N bytes (when encoded 
  using UTF-8) are indexed.  FTS4 uses term prefix indexes to speed up
  <a href="fts3.html#termprefix">prefix queries</a>. The cost, of course, is that indexing term prefixes as
  well as complete terms increases the database size and slows down write 
  operations on the FTS4 table.

<p>
  Prefix indexes may be used to optimize <a href="fts3.html#termprefix">prefix queries</a> in two cases.
  If the query is for a prefix of N bytes, then a prefix index created
  with "prefix=N" provides the best optimization. Or, if no "prefix=N"
  index is available, a "prefix=N+1" index may be used instead. 
  Using a "prefix=N+1" index is less
  efficient than a "prefix=N" index, but is better than no prefix index at all.

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create an FTS4 table with indexes to optimize 2 and 4 byte prefix queries.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t1 USING fts4(c1, c2, prefix="2,4");

<i>-- The following two queries are both optimized using the prefix indexes.</i>
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'ab*';
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1 MATCH 'abcd*';

<i>-- The following two queries are both partially optimized using the prefix</i>
<i>-- indexes. The optimization is not as pronounced as it is for the queries</i>
<i>-- above, but still an improvement over no prefix indexes at all.</i>

<h1 id="commands">7. Special Commands For FTS3 and FTS4</h1>

<p>
  Special INSERT operates can be used to issue commands to FTS3 and FTS4 tables.
  Every FTS3 and FTS4 has a hidden, read-only column which is the same name as
  the table itself.  INSERTs into this hidden column are interpreted as commands
  to the FTS3/4 table.  For a table with the name "xyz" the following commands
  are supported:

<ul>
<li><p>INSERT INTO xyz(xyz) VALUES('optimize');</p>
<li><p>INSERT INTO xyz(xyz) VALUES('rebuild');</p>
<li><p>INSERT INTO xyz(xyz) VALUES('integrity-check');</p>
<li><p>INSERT INTO xyz(xyz) VALUES('merge=X,Y');</p>
<li><p>INSERT INTO xyz(xyz) VALUES('automerge=N');</p>
</ul>

<a name="*fts4optcmd"></a>

<h2 id="optimize">7.1. The "optimize" command</h2>

<p>
  The "optimize" command causes FTS3/4 to merge together all of its
  inverted index b-trees into one large and complete b-tree.  Doing
  an optimize will make subsequent queries run faster since there are
  fewer b-trees to search, and it may reduce disk usage by coalescing
  redundant entries.  However, for a large FTS table, running optimize
  can be as expensive as running <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a>.  The optimize command
  essentially has to read and write the entire FTS table, resulting
  in a large transaction.

<p>
  In batch-mode operation, where an FTS table is initially built up
  using a large number of INSERT operations, then queried repeatedly
  without further changes, it is often a good idea
  to run "optimize" after the last INSERT and before the first query.

<a name="*fts4rebuidcmd"></a>

<h2 id="rebuild">7.2. The "rebuild" command</h2>

<p>
  The "rebuild" command causes SQLite to discard the entire FTS3/4
  table and then rebuild it again from original text.  The concept
  is similar to <a href="lang_reindex.html">REINDEX</a>, only that it applies to an
  FTS3/4 table instead of an ordinary index.

<p>
  The "rebuild" command should be run whenever the implementation
  of a custom tokenizer changes, so that all content can be retokenized.
  The "rebuild" command is also useful when using the
  <a href="fts3.html#*fts4content">FTS4 content option</a> after changes have been made to the original
  content table.

<a name="*fts4ickcmd"></a>

<h2 id="integcheck">7.3. The "integrity-check" command</h2>

<p>
  The "integrity-check" command causes SQLite to read and verify
  the accuracy of all inverted indices in an FTS3/4 table by comparing
  those inverted indices against the original content. The 
  "integrity-check" command silently succeeds if the inverted
  indices are all ok, but will fail with an SQLITE_CORRUPT error
  if any problems are found.

<p>
  The "integrity-check" command is similar in concept to
 <a href="pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check">PRAGMA integrity_check</a>.  In a working system, the "integrity-command"
 should always be successful.  Possible causes of integrity-check
 failures include:
  <ul>
  <li> The application has made changes to the <a href="fts3.html#*shadowtab">FTS shadow tables</a>
       directly, without using the FTS3/4 virtual table, causing
       the shadow tables to become out of sync with each other.
  <li> Using the <a href="fts3.html#*fts4content">FTS4 content option</a> and failing to manually keep
       the content in sync with the FTS4 inverted indices.
  <li> Bugs in the FTS3/4 virtual table.  (The "integrity-check"
       command was original conceived as part of the test suite
       for FTS3/4.)
  <li> Corruption to the underlying SQLite database file.  (See
       documentation on <a href="howtocorrupt.html">how to corrupt</a> and SQLite database for
       additional information.)
  </ul>

<a name="*fts4mergecmd"></a>

<h2 id="mergecmd">7.4. The "merge=X,Y" command</h2>

<p>
  The "merge=X,Y" command (where X and Y are integers) causes SQLite
  to do a limited amount of work toward merging the various inverted
  index b-trees of an FTS3/4 table together into one large b-tree.
  The X value is the target number of "blocks" to be merged, and Y is
  the minimum number of b-tree segments on a level required before
  merging will be applied to that level.  The value of Y should
  be between 2 and 16 with a recommended value of 8.  The value of X
  can be any positive integer but values on the order of 100 to 300
  are recommended.

<p>
  When an FTS table accumulates 16 b-tree segments at the same level,
  the next INSERT into that table will cause all 16 segments to be
  merged into a single b-tree segment at the next higher level.  The
  effect of these level merges is that most INSERTs into an FTS table
  are very fast and take minimal memory, but an occasional INSERT is
  slow and generates a large transaction because of the need to
  do merging. This results in "spiky" performance of INSERTs.

<p>
  To avoid spiky INSERT performance, an application can run the
  "merge=X,Y" command periodically, possibly in an idle thread or
  idle process, to ensure that the FTS table never accumulates
  too many b-tree segments at the same level.  INSERT performance
  spikes can generally be avoided, and performance of FTS3/4 can be
  maximized, by running "merge=X,Y" after every few thousand
  document inserts.  Each "merge=X,Y" command will run in a separate
  transaction (unless they are grouped together using <a href="lang_transaction.html">BEGIN</a>...<a href="lang_transaction.html">COMMIT</a>,
  of course).  The transactions can be kept small by choosing a value
  for X in the range of 100 to 300.  The idle thread that is running
  the merge commands can know when it is done by checking the difference
  in <a href="c3ref/total_changes.html">sqlite3_total_changes()</a> before and after each "merge=X,Y"
  command and stopping the loop when the difference drops below two.

<a name="*fts4automergecmd"></a>

<h2 id="automerge"">7.5. The "automerge=N" command</h2>

<p>
  The "automerge=N" command (where N is an integer between 0 and 15,
  inclusive) is used to configure an FTS3/4 tables "automerge" parameter,
  which controls automatic incremental inverted index merging. The default 
  automerge value for new tables is 0, meaning that automatic incremental 
  merging is completely disabled. If the value of the automerge parameter
  is modified using the "automerge=N" command, the new parameter value is
  stored persistently in the database and is used by all subsequently
  established database connections.

<p>
  Setting the automerge parameter to a non-zero value enables automatic
  incremental merging. This causes SQLite to do a small amount of inverted 
  index merging after every INSERT operation. The amount of merging 
  performed is designed so that the FTS3/4 table never reaches a point 
  where it has 16 segments at the same level and hence has to do a large 
  merge in order to complete an insert.  In other words, automatic 
  incremental merging is designed to prevent spiky INSERT performance.

<p>
  The downside of automatic incremental merging is that it makes
  every INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operation on an FTS3/4 table run
  a little slower, since extra time must be used to do the incremental
  merge.  For maximum performance, it is recommended that applications
  disable automatic incremental merge and instead use the 
  <a href="fts3.html#*fts4mergecmd">"merge" command</a> in an idle process to keep the inverted indices
  well merged.  But if the structure of an application does not easily
  allow for idle processes, the use of automatic incremental merge is
  a very reasonable fallback solution.

<p>
  The actual value of the automerge parameter determines the number of
  index segments merged simultaneously by an automatic inverted index
  merge. If the value is set to N, the system waits until there are at
  least N segments on a single level before beginning to incrementally
  merge them. Setting a lower value of N causes segments to be merged more
  quickly, which may speed up full-text queries and, if the workload 
  contains UPDATE or DELETE operations as well as INSERTs, reduce the space
  on disk consumed by the full-text index. However, it also increases the
  amount of data written to disk.

<p>
  For general use in cases where the workload contains few UPDATE or DELETE
  operations, a good choice for automerge is 8. If the workload contains
  many UPDATE or DELETE commands, 
  or if query speed is a concern, it may be advantageous to reduce automerge
  to 2.

<p>
  For reasons of backwards compatibility, the "automerge=1" command sets
  the automerge parameter to 8, not 1 (a value of 1 would make no sense 
  anyway, as merging data from a single segment is a no-op).


<a name="tokenizer"></a>
<h1 id="tokenizer">8. Tokenizers</h1>

<p>
  An FTS tokenizer is a set of rules for extracting terms from a document 
  or basic FTS full-text query. 

<p>
  Unless a specific tokenizer is specified as part of the CREATE 
  VIRTUAL TABLE statement used to create the FTS table, the default 
  tokenizer, "simple", is used. The simple tokenizer extracts tokens from
  a document or basic FTS full-text query according to the following 
  rules:

<ul>
  <li><p> A term is a contiguous sequence of eligible characters, where 
    eligible characters are all alphanumeric characters and all characters with
    Unicode codepoint values greater than or equal to 128.
    All other characters are
    discarded when splitting a document into terms. Their only contribution is
    to separate adjacent terms.

  <li><p> All uppercase characters within the ASCII range (Unicode codepoints
    less than 128), are transformed to their lowercase equivalents as part
    of the tokenization process. Thus, full-text queries are
    case-insensitive when using the simple tokenizer.
</ul>

<p>
  For example, when a document containing the text "Right now, they're very
  frustrated.", the terms extracted from the document and added to the 
  full-text index are, in order, "right now they re very frustrated". Such
  a document would match a full-text query such as "MATCH 'Frustrated'", 
  as the simple tokenizer transforms the term in the query to lowercase
  before searching the full-text index.

<p>
  As well as the "simple" tokenizer, the FTS source code features a tokenizer 
  that uses the <a href="http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/">Porter 
  Stemming algorithm</a>. This tokenizer uses the same rules to separate
  the input document into terms including folding all terms into lower case,
  but also uses the Porter Stemming algorithm to reduce related English language
  words to a common root. For example, using the same input document as in the
  paragraph above, the porter tokenizer extracts the following tokens:
  "right now thei veri frustrat". Even though some of these terms are not even
  English words, in some cases using them to build the full-text index is more
  useful than the more intelligible output produced by the simple tokenizer.
  Using the porter tokenizer, the document not only matches full-text queries
  such as "MATCH 'Frustrated'", but also queries such as "MATCH 'Frustration'",
  as the term "Frustration" is reduced by the Porter stemmer algorithm to 
  "frustrat" - just as "Frustrated" is. So, when using the porter tokenizer,
  FTS is able to find not just exact matches for queried terms, but matches
  against similar English language terms. For more information on the 
  Porter Stemmer algorithm, please refer to the page linked above.

<p>
  Example illustrating the difference between the "simple" and "porter"
  tokenizers:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create a table using the simple tokenizer. Insert a document into it.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE simple USING fts3(tokenize=simple);
INSERT INTO simple VALUES('Right now they''re very frustrated');

<i>-- The first of the following two queries matches the document stored in</i>
<i>-- table "simple". The second does not.</i>
SELECT * FROM simple WHERE simple MATCH 'Frustrated';
SELECT * FROM simple WHERE simple MATCH 'Frustration';

<i>-- Create a table using the porter tokenizer. Insert the same document into it</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE porter USING fts3(tokenize=porter);
INSERT INTO porter VALUES('Right now they''re very frustrated');

<i>-- Both of the following queries match the document stored in table "porter".</i>
SELECT * FROM porter WHERE porter MATCH 'Frustrated';
SELECT * FROM porter WHERE porter MATCH 'Frustration';
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  If this extension is compiled with the SQLITE_ENABLE_ICU pre-processor
  symbol defined, then there exists a built-in tokenizer named "icu"
  implemented using the ICU library. The first argument passed to the
  xCreate() method (see fts3_tokenizer.h) of this tokenizer may be
  an ICU locale identifier. For example "tr_TR" for Turkish as used
  in Turkey, or "en_AU" for English as used in Australia. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE thai_text USING fts3(text, tokenize=icu th_TH)
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The ICU tokenizer implementation is very simple. It splits the input
  text according to the ICU rules for finding word boundaries and discards
  any tokens that consist entirely of white-space. This may be suitable
  for some applications in some locales, but not all. If more complex
  processing is required, for example to implement stemming or
  discard punctuation, this can be done by creating a tokenizer
  implementation that uses the ICU tokenizer as part of its implementation.

<a name="unicode61"></a>

<p>
  The "unicode61" tokenizer is available beginning with SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_13.html">version 3.7.13</a>.
  Unicode61 works very much like "simple" except that it does simple unicode
  case folding according to rules in Unicode Version 6.1 and it recognizes
  unicode space and punctuation characters and uses those to separate tokens.
  The simple tokenizer only does case folding of ASCII characters and only
  recognizes ASCII space and punctuation characters as token separators.

<p>
  By default, "unicode61" also removes all diacritics from Latin script
  characters. This behaviour can be overridden by adding the tokenizer argument
  "remove_diacritics=0". For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create tables that remove diacritics from Latin script characters</i>
<i>-- as part of tokenization.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE txt1 USING fts4(tokenize=unicode61);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE txt2 USING fts4(tokenize=unicode61 "remove_diacritics=1");

<i>-- Create a table that does not remove diacritics from Latin script</i>
<i>-- characters as part of tokenization.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE txt3 USING fts4(tokenize=unicode61 "remove_diacritics=0");
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  It is also possible to customize the set of codepoints that unicode61 treats
  as separator characters. The "separators=" option may be used to specify one
  or more extra characters that should be treated as separator characters, and
  the "tokenchars=" option may be used to specify one or more extra characters
  that should be treated as part of tokens instead of as separator characters.
  For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create a table that uses the unicode61 tokenizer, but considers "."</i>
<i>-- and "=" characters to be part of tokens, and capital "X" characters to</i>
<i>-- function as separators.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE txt3 USING fts4(tokenize=unicode61 "tokenchars=.=" "separators=X");

<i>-- Create a table that considers space characters (codepoint 32) to be</i>
<i>-- a token character</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE txt4 USING fts4(tokenize=unicode61 "tokenchars= ");
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  If a character specified as part of the argument to "tokenchars=" is considered
  to be a token character by default, it is ignored. This is true even if it has
  been marked as a separator by an earlier "separators=" option. Similarly, if
  a character specified as part of a "separators=" option is treated as a separator
  character by default, it is ignored. If multiple "tokenchars=" or "separators="
  options are specified, all are processed. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Create a table that uses the unicode61 tokenizer, but considers "."</i>
<i>-- and "=" characters to be part of tokens, and capital "X" characters to</i>
<i>-- function as separators. Both of the "tokenchars=" options are processed</i>
<i>-- The "separators=" option ignores the "." passed to it, as "." is by</i>
<i>-- default a separator character, even though it has been marked as a token</i>
<i>-- character by an earlier "tokenchars=" option.</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE txt5 USING fts4(
    tokenize=unicode61 "tokenchars=." "separators=X." "tokenchars=="
);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The arguments passed to the "tokenchars=" or "separators=" options are 
  case-sensitive. In the example above, specifying that "X" is a separator
  character does not affect the way "x" is handled.

<a name="f3tknzr"></a>

<h2 id="section_8_1">8.1. Custom (Application Defined) Tokenizers</h2>

<p>
  In addition to providing built-in "simple", "porter" and (possibly) "icu" and
  "unicode61" tokenizers,
  FTS provides an interface for applications to implement and register custom
  tokenizers written in C.  The interface used to create a new tokenizer is defined
  and described in the fts3_tokenizer.h source file.

<p>
  Registering a new FTS tokenizer is similar to registering a new
  virtual table module with SQLite. The user passes a pointer to a
  structure containing pointers to various callback functions that
  make up the implementation of the new tokenizer type. For tokenizers,
  the structure (defined in fts3_tokenizer.h) is called
  "sqlite3_tokenizer_module".

<p>
  FTS does not expose a C-function that users call to register new
  tokenizer types with a database handle. Instead, the pointer must
  be encoded as an SQL blob value and passed to FTS through the SQL
  engine by evaluating a special scalar function, "fts3_tokenizer()".
  The fts3_tokenizer() function may be called with one or two arguments,
  as follows:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">SELECT fts3_tokenizer(&lt;tokenizer-name&gt;);
SELECT fts3_tokenizer(&lt;tokenizer-name&gt;, &lt;sqlite3_tokenizer_module ptr&gt;);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  Where &lt;tokenizer-name&gt; is a string identifying the tokenizer and
  &lt;sqlite3_tokenizer_module ptr&gt; is a pointer to an sqlite3_tokenizer_module
  structure encoded as an SQL blob. If the second argument is present,
  it is registered as tokenizer &lt;tokenizer-name&gt; and a copy of it
  returned. If only one argument is passed, a pointer to the tokenizer
  implementation currently registered as &lt;tokenizer-name&gt; is returned,
  encoded as a blob. Or, if no such tokenizer exists, an SQL exception
  (error) is raised.

<p>
  Because of security concerns, SQLite version 3.11.0 only enabled the
  second form of the fts3_tokenizer() function when the library is compiled
  with the <a href="compile.html#enable_fts3_tokenizer">-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_TOKENIZER</a>
  option. In earlier versions it was
  always available.  Beginning with SQLite version 3.12.0, the second form of
  fts3_tokenizer() can also be activated at run-time by calling
  <a href="c3ref/db_config.html">sqlite3_db_config</a>(db,<a href="c3ref/c_dbconfig_enable_fkey.html">SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_FTS3_TOKENIZER</a>,1,0).

<p>
  <b>SECURITY WARNING</b>: 
  If a version of the fts3/4 extension that supports the two-argument form of
  fts3_tokenizer() is deployed in an environment where malicious users can
  run arbitrary SQL, then those users should be prevented from invoking the 
  two-argument fts3_tokenizer() function.
  This can be done using the <a href="c3ref/set_authorizer.html">authorization callback</a>, 
  or by disabling the two-argument fts3_tokenizer() interface using a
  call to
  <a href="c3ref/db_config.html">sqlite3_db_config</a>(db,<a href="c3ref/c_dbconfig_enable_fkey.html">SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_FTS3_TOKENIZER</a>,0,0).

<h2 id="section_8_2">8.2. Querying Tokenizers</h2>

<p>The "fts3tokenize" virtual table can be used to directly access any
   tokenizer.  The following SQL demonstrates how to create an instance 
   of the fts3tokenize virtual table:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE tok1 USING fts3tokenize('porter');
</pre></table></div>

<p>The name of the desired tokenizer should be substituted in place of
   'porter' in the example, of course.  If the tokenizer requires one or
   more arguments, they should be separated by commas in the fts3tokenize
   declaration (even though they are separated by spaces in declarations
   of regular fts4 tables). The following creates fts4 and fts3tokenize
   tables that use the same tokenizer:
<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE text1 USING fts4(tokenize=icu en_AU);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE tokens1 USING fts3tokenize(icu, en_AU);

CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE text2 USING fts4(tokenize=unicode61 "tokenchars=@." "separators=123");
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE tokens2 USING fts3tokenize(unicode61, "tokenchars=@.", "separators=123");
</pre></table></div>
   
<p>
   Once the virtual table is created, it can be queried as follows:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">SELECT token, start, end, position 
  FROM tok1
 WHERE input='This is a test sentence.';
</pre></table></div>

<p>The virtual table will return one row of output for each token in the
   input string.  The "token" column is the text of the token.  The "start"
   and "end" columns are the byte offset to the beginning and end of the
   token in the original input string.  
   The "position" column is the sequence number
   of the token in the original input string.  There is also an "input"
   column which is simply a copy of the input string that is specified in
   the WHERE clause.  Note that a constraint of the form "input=?" must
   appear in the WHERE clause or else the virtual table will have no input
   to tokenize and will return no rows.  The example above generates
   the following output:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">thi|0|4|0
is|5|7|1
a|8|9|2
test|10|14|3
sentenc|15|23|4
</pre></table></div>

<p>Notice that the tokens in the result set from the fts3tokenize virtual
   table have been transformed according to the rules of the tokenizer.
   Since this example used the "porter" tokenizer, the "This" token was
   converted into "thi".  If the original text of the token is desired,
   it can be retrieved using the "start" and "end" columns with the
   <a href="lang_corefunc.html#substr">substr()</a> function.  For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">SELECT substr(input, start+1, end-start), token, position
  FROM tok1
 WHERE input='This is a test sentence.';
</pre></table></div>

<p>The fts3tokenize virtual table can be used on any tokenizer, regardless
   of whether or not there exists an FTS3 or FTS4 table that actually uses
   that tokenizer.

<h1 id="section_9">9. Data Structures</h1>

<p>
  This section describes at a high-level the way the FTS module stores its
  index and content in the database. It is <b>not necessary to read or 
  understand the material in this section in order to use FTS</b> in an 
  application. However, it may be useful to application developers attempting 
  to analyze and understand FTS performance characteristics, or to developers 
  contemplating enhancements to the existing FTS feature set.
</p>

<a name="*shadowtab"></a>

<a name="section_9_1"></a>
<h2 id="section_9_1">9.1. Shadow Tables</h2>
<p>
  For each FTS virtual table in a database, three to five real (non-virtual) tables
  are created to store the underlying data.  These real tables are called "shadow tables".
  The real tables are named "%_content",
  "%_segdir", "%_segments", "%_stat", and "%_docsize", where "%" is replaced by the name
  of the FTS virtual table.

<p>
  The leftmost column of the "%_content" table is an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY field
  named "docid". Following this is one column for each column of the FTS
  virtual table as declared by the user, named by prepending the column name
  supplied by the user with "c<i>N</i>", where <i>N</i> is the index of the 
  column within the table, numbered from left to right starting with 0. Data
  types supplied as part of the virtual table declaration are not used as
  part of the %_content table declaration. For example:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- Virtual table declaration</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE abc USING fts4(a NUMBER, b TEXT, c);

<i>-- Corresponding %_content table declaration</i>
CREATE TABLE abc_content(docid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, c0a, c1b, c2c);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The %_content table contains the unadulterated data inserted by the user 
  into the FTS virtual table by the user. If the user does not explicitly
  supply a "docid" value when inserting records, one is selected automatically
  by the system.

<p>
  The %_stat and %_docsize tables are only created if the FTS table uses the
  FTS4 module, not FTS3. Furthermore, the %_docsize table is omitted if the
  FTS4 table is created with the <a href="fts3.html#fts4matchinfo">"matchinfo=fts3"</a> directive
  specified as part of the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement. If they are created,
  the schema of the two tables is as follows:
<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE TABLE %_stat(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
  value BLOB
);

CREATE TABLE %_docsize(
  docid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  size BLOB
);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  For each row in the FTS table, the %_docsize table contains a corresponding
  row with the same "docid" value. The "size" field contains a blob consisting
  of <i>N</i> FTS varints, where <i>N</i> is the number of user-defined columns
  in the table. Each varint in the "size" blob is the number of tokens in the
  corresponding column of the associated row in the FTS table. The %_stat table
  always contains a single row with the "id" column set to 0. The "value" 
  column contains a blob consisting of <i>N+1</i> FTS varints, where <i>N</i>
  is again the number of user-defined columns in the FTS table. The first
  varint in the blob is set to the total number of rows in the FTS table. The
  second and subsequent varints contain the total number of tokens stored in
  the corresponding column for all rows of the FTS table.

<p>
  The two remaining tables, %_segments and %_segdir, are used to store the 
  full-text index. Conceptually, this index is a lookup table that maps each 
  term (word) to the set of docid values corresponding to records in the 
  %_content table that contain one or more occurrences of the term. To
  retrieve all documents that contain a specified term, the FTS module
  queries this index to determine the set of docid values for records that
  contain the term, then retrieves the required documents from the %_content
  table. Regardless of the schema of the FTS virtual table, the %_segments
  and %_segdir tables are always created as follows:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">CREATE TABLE %_segments(
  blockid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,       <i>-- B-tree node id</i>
  block blob                         <i>-- B-tree node data</i>
);

CREATE TABLE %_segdir(
  level INTEGER,
  idx INTEGER,
  start_block INTEGER,               <i>-- Blockid of first node in %_segments</i>
  leaves_end_block INTEGER,          <i>-- Blockid of last leaf node in %_segments</i>
  end_block INTEGER,                 <i>-- Blockid of last node in %_segments</i>
  root BLOB,                         <i>-- B-tree root node</i>
  PRIMARY KEY(level, idx)
);
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The schema depicted above is not designed to store the full-text index 
  directly. Instead, it is used to one or more b-tree structures. There
  is one b-tree for each row in the %_segdir table. The %_segdir table
  row contains the root node and various meta-data associated with the
  b-tree structure, and the %_segments table contains all other (non-root)
  b-tree nodes. Each b-tree is referred to as a "segment". Once it has
  been created, a segment b-tree is never updated (although it may be
  deleted altogether).

<p>
  The keys used by each segment b-tree are terms (words). As well as the
  key, each segment b-tree entry has an associated "doclist" (document list).
  A doclist consists of zero or more entries, where each entry consists of:

<ul>
  <li> A docid (document id), and
  <li> A list of term offsets, one for each occurrence of the term within
       the document. A term offset indicates the number of tokens (words)
       that occur before the term in question, not the number of characters
       or bytes. For example, the term offset of the term "war" in the
       phrase "Ancestral voices prophesying war!" is 3.
</ul>

<p>
  Entries within a doclist are sorted by docid. Positions within a doclist
  entry are stored in ascending order.

<p>
  The contents of the logical full-text index is found by merging the
  contents of all segment b-trees. If a term is present in more than one
  segment b-tree, then it maps to the union of each individual doclist. If,
  for a single term, the same docid occurs in more than one doclist, then only
  the doclist that is part of the most recently created segment b-tree is 
  considered valid. 

<p>
  Multiple b-tree structures are used instead of a single b-tree to reduce
  the cost of inserting records into FTS tables. When a new record is 
  inserted into an FTS table that already contains a lot of data, it is
  likely that many of the terms in the new record are already present in
  a large number of existing records. If a single b-tree were used, then
  large doclist structures would have to be loaded from the database,
  amended to include the new docid and term-offset list, then written back
  to the database. Using multiple b-tree tables allows this to be avoided
  by creating a new b-tree which can be merged with the existing b-tree
  (or b-trees) later on. Merging of b-tree structures can be performed as
  a background task, or once a certain number of separate b-tree structures
  have been accumulated. Of course, this scheme makes queries more expensive
  (as the FTS code may have to look up individual terms in more than one
  b-tree and merge the results), but it has been found that in practice this
  overhead is often negligible.
  
<h2 id="section_9_2">9.2. Variable Length Integer (varint) Format</h2>

<p>
  Integer values stored as part of segment b-tree nodes are encoded using the
  FTS varint format. This encoding is similar, but <b>not identical</b>, to
  the <a href="fileformat.html#varint_format">SQLite varint format</a>.

<p>
  An encoded FTS varint consumes between one and ten bytes of space. The
  number of bytes required is determined by the sign and magnitude of the
  integer value encoded. More accurately, the number of bytes used to store
  the encoded integer depends on the position of the most significant set bit
  in the 64-bit twos-complement representation of the integer value. Negative
  values always have the most significant bit set (the sign bit), and so are
  always stored using the full ten bytes. Positive integer values may be
  stored using less space.

<p>
  The final byte of an encoded FTS varint has its most significant bit 
  cleared. All preceding bytes have the most significant bit set. Data
  is stored in the remaining seven least significant bits of each byte.
  The first byte of the encoded representation contains the least significant
  seven bits of the encoded integer value. The second byte of the encoded
  representation, if it is present, contains the seven next least significant
  bits of the integer value, and so on. The following table contains examples
  of encoded integer values:

<table style="margin:1em auto; width:80%; border-spacing:0">
  <tr style="text-align:left"><th>Decimal<th>Hexadecimal<th width="100%">Encoded Representation
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>43<td>0x000000000000002B<td>0x2B 
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>200815<td>0x000000000003106F<td>0x9C 0xA0 0x0C
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>-1<td>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF<td>0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0x01
</table>
  

<h2 id="section_9_3">9.3. Segment B-Tree Format</h2>

<p>
  Segment b-trees are prefix-compressed b+-trees. There is one segment b-tree
  for each row in the %_segdir table (see above). The root node of the segment
  b-tree is stored as a blob in the "root" field of the corresponding row
  of the %_segdir table. All other nodes (if any exist) are stored in the 
  "blob" column of the %_segments table. Nodes within the %_segments table are
  identified by the integer value in the blockid field of the corresponding
  row. The following table describes the fields of the %_segdir table:

<table style="margin:1em auto; width:80%; border-spacing:0">
  <tr style="text-align:left"><th>Column           <th width="100%">Interpretation
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>level            <td> 
    Between them, the contents of the "level" and "idx" fields define the
    relative age of the segment b-tree. The smaller the value stored in the
    "level" field, the more recently the segment b-tree was created. If two
    segment b-trees are of the same "level", the segment with the larger
    value stored in the "idx" column is more recent. The PRIMARY KEY constraint
    on the %_segdir table prevents any two segments from having the same value
    for both the "level" and "idx" fields.
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>idx              <td> See above.
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>start_block      <td>
    The blockid that corresponds to the node with the smallest blockid that 
    belongs to this segment b-tree. Or zero if the entire segment b-tree
    fits on the root node. If it exists, this node is always a leaf node.
  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>leaves_end_block <td>
    The blockid that corresponds to the leaf node with the largest blockid 
    that belongs to this segment b-tree. Or zero if the entire segment b-tree
    fits on the root node.
  <tr style="text-align:left;background-color:#DDDDDD"><td>end_block <td>
    This field may contain either an integer or a text field consisting of
    two integers separated by a space character (unicode codepoint 0x20).
<p style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0">
    The first, or only, integer is the blockid that corresponds to the interior
    node with the largest blockid that belongs to this segment b-tree. Or zero
    if the entire segment b-tree fits on the root node. If it exists, this node
    is always an interior node.
<p style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;margin-bottom:0">
    The second integer, if it is present, is the aggregate size of all data
    stored on leaf pages in bytes. If the value is negative, then the segment
    is the output of an unfinished incremental-merge operation, and the
    absolute value is current size in bytes.

  <tr style="text-align:left"><td>root             <td>
    Blob containing the root node of the segment b-tree.
</table>

<p>
  Apart from the root node, the nodes that make up a single segment b-tree are
  always stored using a contiguous sequence of blockids. Furthermore, the
  nodes that make up a single level of the b-tree are themselves stored as
  a contiguous block, in b-tree order. The contiguous sequence of blockids
  used to store the b-tree leaves are allocated starting with the blockid
  value stored in the "start_block" column of the corresponding %_segdir row,
  and finishing at the blockid value stored in the "leaves_end_block"
  field of the same row. It is therefore possible to iterate through all the
  leaves of a segment b-tree, in key order, by traversing the %_segments 
  table in blockid order from "start_block" to "leaves_end_block".

<p>
  The first term stored on each node ("Term 1" in the figure above) is
  stored verbatim. Each subsequent term is prefix-compressed with respect
  to its predecessor. Terms are stored within a page in sorted (memcmp)
  order.

<h2 id="section_9_4">9.4. Doclist Format</h2>

<p>
  A doclist consists of an array of 64-bit signed integers, serialized using
  the FTS varint format. Each doclist entry is made up of a series of two 
  or more integers, as follows:

<ol>
  <li> The docid value. The first entry in a doclist contains the literal docid
       value. The first field of each subsequent doclist entry contains the 
       difference between the new docid and the previous one (always a positive 
       number).
  <li> Zero or more term-offset lists. A term-offset list is present for each
       column of the FTS virtual table that contains the term. A term-offset
       list consists of the following:
     <ol>
       <li> Constant value 1. This field is omitted for any term-offset list
            associated with column 0.
       <li> The column number (1 for the second leftmost column, etc.). This
            field is omitted for any term-offset list associated with column 0.
       <li> A list of term-offsets, sorted from smallest to largest. Instead
            of storing the term-offset value literally, each integer stored 
            is the difference between the current term-offset and the previous 
            one (or zero if the current term-offset is the first), plus 2.
     </ol>
  <li> Constant value 0.
</ol>

</center>

<p>
  For doclists for which the term appears in more than one column of the FTS
  virtual table, term-offset lists within the doclist are stored in column 
  number order. This ensures that the term-offset list associated with 
  column 0 (if any) is always first, allowing the first two fields of the
  term-offset list to be omitted in this case.

<a name="appendix_a"></a>
<h1 id="appendix_a"> 
  Appendix A: Search Application Tips
</h1>

<p>
  FTS is primarily designed to support Boolean full-text queries - queries
  to find the set of documents that match a specified criteria. However, many 
  (most?) search applications require that results are somehow ranked in order
  of "relevance", where "relevance" is defined as the likelihood that the user
  who performed the search is interested in a specific element of the returned
  set of documents. When using a search engine to find documents on the world
  wide web, the user expects that the most useful, or "relevant", documents 
  will be returned as the first page of results, and that each subsequent page 
  contains progressively less relevant results. Exactly how a machine can 
  determine document relevance based on a users query is a complicated problem
  and the subject of much ongoing research.

<p>
  One very simple scheme might be to count the number of instances of the 
  users search terms in each result document. Those documents that contain
  many instances of the terms are considered more relevant than those with
  a small number of instances of each term. In an FTS application, the 
  number of term instances in each result could be determined by counting
  the number of integers in the return value of the <a href="fts3.html#offsets">offsets</a> function.
  The following example shows a query that could be used to obtain the
  ten most relevant results for a query entered by the user:

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- This example (and all others in this section) assumes the following schema</i>
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE documents USING fts3(title, content);

<i>-- Assuming the application has supplied an SQLite user function named "countintegers"</i>
<i>-- that returns the number of space-separated integers contained in its only argument,</i>
<i>-- the following query could be used to return the titles of the 10 documents that contain</i>
<i>-- the greatest number of instances of the users query terms. Hopefully, these 10</i>
<i>-- documents will be those that the users considers more or less the most "relevant".</i>
SELECT title FROM documents 
  WHERE documents MATCH &lt;query&gt;
  ORDER BY countintegers(offsets(documents)) DESC
  LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The query above could be made to run faster by using the FTS <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo">matchinfo</a>
  function to determine the number of query term instances that appear in each
  result. The matchinfo function is much more efficient than the offsets 
  function. Furthermore, the matchinfo function provides extra information
  regarding the overall number of occurrences of each query term in the entire
  document set (not just the current row) and the number of documents in which 
  each query term appears. This may be used (for example) to attach a higher
  weight to less common terms which may increase the overall computed relevancy 
  of those results the user considers more interesting.

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- If the application supplies an SQLite user function called "rank" that</i>
<i>-- interprets the blob of data returned by matchinfo and returns a numeric</i>
<i>-- relevancy based on it, then the following SQL may be used to return the</i>
<i>-- titles of the 10 most relevant documents in the dataset for a users query.</i>
SELECT title FROM documents 
  WHERE documents MATCH &lt;query&gt;
  ORDER BY rank(matchinfo(documents)) DESC
  LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The SQL query in the example above uses less CPU than the first example
  in this section, but still has a non-obvious performance problem. SQLite
  satisfies this query by retrieving the value of the "title" column and
  matchinfo data from the FTS module for every row matched by the users
  query before it sorts and limits the results. Because of the way SQLite's
  virtual table interface works, retrieving the value of the "title" column
  requires loading the entire row from disk (including the "content" field,
  which may be quite large). This means that if the users query matches
  several thousand documents, many megabytes of "title" and "content" data
  may be loaded from disk into memory even though they will never be used
  for any purpose. 

<p>
  The SQL query in the following example block is one solution to this 
  problem. In SQLite, when a <a href="optoverview.html#flattening">sub-query 
  used in a join contains a LIMIT clause</a>, the results of the sub-query are
  calculated and stored in temporary table before the main query is executed.
  This means that SQLite will load only the docid and matchinfo data for each
  row matching the users query into memory, determine the docid values
  corresponding to the ten most relevant documents, then load only the title
  and content information for those 10 documents only. Because both the matchinfo
  and docid values are gleaned entirely from the full-text index, this results
  in dramatically less data being loaded from the database into memory.

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em">SELECT title FROM documents JOIN ( 
    SELECT docid, rank(matchinfo(documents)) AS rank 
    FROM documents
    WHERE documents MATCH &lt;query&gt;
    ORDER BY rank DESC 
    LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
) AS ranktable USING(docid)
ORDER BY ranktable.rank DESC
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  The next block of SQL enhances the query with solutions to two other problems
  that may arise in developing search applications using FTS:

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       The <a href="fts3.html#snippet">snippet</a> function cannot be used with the above query. Because
       the outer query does not include a "WHERE ... MATCH" clause, the snippet 
       function may not be used with it. One solution is to duplicate the WHERE
       clause used by the sub-query in the outer query. The overhead associated
       with this is usually negligible.
  <li> <p>
       The relevancy of a document may depend on something other than just
       the data available in the return value of matchinfo. For example
       each document in the database may be assigned a static weight based
       on factors unrelated to its content (origin, author, age, number
       of references etc.). These values can be stored by the application
       in a separate table that can be joined against the documents table
       in the sub-query so that the rank function may access them.
</ol>

<p>
  This version of the query is very similar to that used by the 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/search?q=fts3">sqlite.org documentation search</a> 
  application.

<div class=codeblock style="margin:0 15ex"><table width=100% style="border:1px solid #80a796;padding:0 1ex;background-color:#EEEEEE"><tr><td><pre style="font-size:1.1em"><i>-- This table stores the static weight assigned to each document in FTS table</i>
<i>-- "documents". For each row in the documents table there is a corresponding row</i>
<i>-- with the same docid value in this table.</i>
CREATE TABLE documents_data(docid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, weight);

<i>-- This query is similar to the one in the block above, except that:</i>
<i>--</i>
<i>--   1. It returns a "snippet" of text along with the document title for display. So</i>
<i>--      that the snippet function may be used, the "WHERE ... MATCH ..." clause from</i>
<i>--      the sub-query is duplicated in the outer query.</i>
<i>--</i>
<i>--   2. The sub-query joins the documents table with the document_data table, so that</i>
<i>--      implementation of the rank function has access to the static weight assigned</i>
<i>--      to each document.</i>
SELECT title, snippet(documents) FROM documents JOIN ( 
    SELECT docid, rank(matchinfo(documents), documents_data.weight) AS rank
    FROM documents JOIN documents_data USING(docid)
    WHERE documents MATCH &lt;query&gt;
    ORDER BY rank DESC 
    LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
) AS ranktable USING(docid)
WHERE documents MATCH &lt;query&gt;
ORDER BY ranktable.rank DESC
</pre></table></div>

<p>
  All the example queries above return the ten most relevant query results.
  By modifying the values used with the OFFSET and LIMIT clauses, a query 
  to return (say) the next ten most relevant results is easy to construct. 
  This may be used to obtain the data required for a search applications second
  and subsequent pages of results.

<p>
  The next block contains an example rank function that uses matchinfo data 
  implemented in C. Instead of a single weight, it allows a weight to be 
  externally assigned to each column of each document. It may be registered
  with SQLite like any other user function using <a href="c3ref/create_function.html">sqlite3_create_function</a>.

<i>** SQLite user defined function to use with matchinfo() to calculate the</i>
<i>** relevancy of an FTS match. The value returned is the relevancy score</i>
<i>** (a real value greater than or equal to zero). A larger value indicates </i>
<i>** a more relevant document.</i>
<i>**</i>
<i>** The overall relevancy returned is the sum of the relevancies of each </i>
<i>** column value in the FTS table. The relevancy of a column value is the</i>
<i>** sum of the following for each reportable phrase in the FTS query:</i>
<i>**</i>
<i>**   (&lt;hit count&gt; / &lt;global hit count&gt) * &lt;column weight&gt;</i>
<i>**</i>
<i>** where &lt;hit count&gt; is the number of instances of the phrase in the</i>
<i>** column value of the current row and &lt;global hit count&gt; is the number</i>
<i>** of instances of the phrase in the same column of all rows in the FTS</i>
<i>** table. The &lt;column weight&gt; is a weighting factor assigned to each</i>
<i>** column by the caller (see below).</i>
<i>**</i>
<i>** The first argument to this function must be the return value of the FTS </i>
<i>** matchinfo() function. Following this must be one argument for each column </i>
<i>** of the FTS table containing a numeric weight factor for the corresponding </i>
<i>** column. Example:</i>
<i>**</i>
<i>**     CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE documents USING fts3(title, content)</i>
<i>**</i>
<i>** The following query returns the docids of documents that match the full-text</i>
<i>** query &lt;query&gt; sorted from most to least relevant. When calculating</i>
<i>** relevance, query term instances in the 'title' column are given twice the</i>
<i>** weighting of those in the 'content' column.</i>
<i>**</i>
<i>**     SELECT docid FROM documents </i>
<i>**     WHERE documents MATCH &lt;query&gt; </i>
